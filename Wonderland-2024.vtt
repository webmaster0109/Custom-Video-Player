00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:42.417
[woman] My father's family name is Bai.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.420
And my mom's is Li.

00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:49.382
So they named me Bai Li. [chuckles]

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:52.218
I'm a fund manager.

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:54.554
I've worked around the world.

00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:57.015
Now I'm based in Korea.

00:00:57.098 --> 00:00:59.100
I live with my mother and daughter.

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:04.272
Actually, my mother didn't want to do it,
but I persuaded her.

00:01:04.856 --> 00:01:06.441
[both laugh]

00:01:06.524 --> 00:01:07.525
[Bai Li] Where's Jia?

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:09.861
[Bai Li] My daughter
doesn't know anything.

00:01:12.447 --> 00:01:13.364
[Bai Li chuckles]

00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:15.742
I always wanted to be her friend.

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:17.243
But I failed.

00:01:18.828 --> 00:01:21.289
I want to try again when I go there.

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:24.501
[both laugh]

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:30.465
You said that, when I'm there,
I won't know that I died, right?

00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:32.175
[melancholy music continues]

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:33.134
[Bai Li sighs]

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:37.138
Nice. I can be an archaeologist.

00:01:39.682 --> 00:01:43.186
That was my dream as a child.

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:44.979
I almost forgot.

00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:47.315
Yeah.

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:48.775
Thank you.

00:01:57.867 --> 00:01:59.494
[woman 1] If we get to meet again,

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:03.540
there's still so much
that I want to say to my parents.

00:02:04.332 --> 00:02:06.918
It's strange saying, "I want my mom."

00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:09.337
I didn't really miss her
all that much before,

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.383
but now that I'm dying, I can't help
but think of the people I've lost.

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:16.261
[woman 2] The person
I want the Wonderland service for is...

00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:20.181
[woman 3] I just want to see
both of my parents comfortable and happy,

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:22.183
living together in a beautiful place.

00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:27.564
[man] I wanted to visit so many places,
but I never got to in my lifetime, so...

00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:30.692
[intriguing music continues]

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:33.570
[woman 4] I would really like
to see my friend again,

00:02:34.737 --> 00:02:36.281
but when she was at her best.

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.204
[woman 5] I wanted to see you again,
even in a dream, but it never happened.

00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:45.290

[PA system] Good afternoon.

00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:12.585
This is the pre-boarding announcement
for flight TH3 028.

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:14.754
We now invite those passengers...

00:04:14.837 --> 00:04:15.755
- [Bai Li] Hm.
- [man] Hm.

00:04:15.838 --> 00:04:16.923
[Bai Li chuckles]

00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:17.924
Traveling alone?

00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:21.594
Uh, yes.

00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:24.847
Is your family there?

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:28.351
No. I'm going there for work.

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.187
My daughter is staying with my mother.

00:04:32.313 --> 00:04:34.232
Uh, I'm an archaeologist.

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:36.276
You explore ruins?

00:04:37.193 --> 00:04:38.278
That's a cool job.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:39.779
Yeah.

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:44.033
My daughter wants to be
an archaeologist as well.

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:46.995
I heard her say that
during daycare's... [speaks Korean]

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:49.372
Oh, at the end-of-year festival.

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:51.165
- [Bai Li] Yes.
- Your Korean is good.

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:52.250
[chuckles]

00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:53.960
- It's perfect.
- [in Korean] A little.

00:04:54.502 --> 00:04:55.378
[chuckles]

00:04:57.088 --> 00:04:59.882
[in English] Are you going away
for a long time?

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:02.051
Um, about

00:05:02.593 --> 00:05:03.636
three months.

00:05:04.053 --> 00:05:04.971
[man] Three months?

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:08.308
Won't you miss your daughter?

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:10.560
[sighs softly]

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:12.228
It's okay.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.815
She's used to it.

00:05:18.359 --> 00:05:21.112
I have arranged everything already, yeah.

00:05:21.612 --> 00:05:22.613
That's good.

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:26.242
[PA system] Attention please.
This is a final call for Luna Airline's...

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:28.953
Okay. I need to go.

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:34.500
Yeah.

- Bye.
- [man] Bye.

Have a good trip.

[Bai Li] Mom, I arrived safely.

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.214
Come on. What's with that face?

00:07:03.714 --> 00:07:06.342
It's so gorgeous here. Hm? You see?

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:09.554
Where's Jia?

00:07:11.013 --> 00:07:11.848
Hey, Jia.

00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:13.891
Mama's on the phone now.

- [Bai Li's mom] Jia?
- [Bai Li] Jia, it's me! Come here.

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:22.859
I have something to show you.

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:27.822
- Oh, I can finally see you!
- Mama.

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:31.742
Do you see this? Ta-da!

00:07:33.786 --> 00:07:36.664
Sweetie, why are you in a bad mood? Hm?

00:07:36.747 --> 00:07:39.208
I guess it's because
it's been a while since I called you?

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:40.751
Sorry.

00:07:41.752 --> 00:07:44.338
Do you know where Mama is right now, hm?

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.634
Hey, take a look at this, Jia.
What animal could this be?

00:07:49.218 --> 00:07:50.344
Can you guess?

[camel snorts]

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:55.057
Do you see it?
It's a cute little camel. Aw.

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:57.143
I hope it doesn't bite me!

00:07:57.935 --> 00:08:00.021
Oh, its hair is super soft.

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:02.440
Go on, you can take it.

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:06.903
Mama's gonna stay
and work for a while, okay?

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.238
I promise I'll call

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:14.202
and show you all the incredible things
I find here every day, all right? Deal?

Rise and shine.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:08.381
- [Jung-in groans]
- [Tae-ju] Wanna sleep more?

00:09:08.464 --> 00:09:12.134
You have five minutes if you're showering.
And 20 if you just wash your hair.

00:09:12.885 --> 00:09:15.513
The airport shuttle will be arriving soon.
What do you wanna do?

00:09:15.596 --> 00:09:18.307
Mm, what if I only wash my hair
and brush my teeth?

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:20.851
[Tae-ju] In that case,
you can sleep for 15 more minutes.

00:09:21.477 --> 00:09:24.313
But now, this conversation
cost you 30 seconds.

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:25.231
[sighs]

00:09:25.856 --> 00:09:28.776
Today is your favorite place. Barcelona.
You're not going?

00:09:29.318 --> 00:09:30.319
[Jung-in] I will.

00:09:31.612 --> 00:09:32.530
I'll go.

00:09:32.613 --> 00:09:34.198
[Tae-ju] That's right, you've got to.

00:09:34.699 --> 00:09:35.783
I'll get up.

00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:45.209
[Tae-ju] Jung-in.

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:47.128
The shuttle left!

00:09:48.045 --> 00:09:49.630
- You need to go right now!
- Wait, it did?

00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:51.924
[Tae-ju] Hurry, you need to go!
Hurry, hurry!

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:53.259
Just kidding.

00:09:53.342 --> 00:09:58.723
- [Jung-in] Ah, shit.
- [Tae-ju laughs]

00:09:58.806 --> 00:10:00.516
Are you kidding me?

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.519
[laughing] Ah, you fell for it again.

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:06.522
- [Jung-in groans]
- [Tae-ju] All right, then. Time to get up.

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:08.816
The weather's clear in Barcelona today.

00:10:09.483 --> 00:10:12.069
It's 16 degrees Celsius. Humidity 58%.

00:10:12.653 --> 00:10:15.031
Your flight'll take 12 hours
and 40 minutes,

00:10:15.114 --> 00:10:17.283
and your estimated
arrival time is 6:40 p.m.

00:10:18.242 --> 00:10:20.244
Barcelona could be a bit chilly,

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:21.579
so take your coat too.

00:10:21.662 --> 00:10:23.831
- Jung-in, your eye drops?
- Oh, that's right!

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.336
- [Tae-ju] And don't forget your vitamins.
- Ah.

00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:32.548
I'm going, then!

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:34.884
- Wake me up a little earlier tomorrow.
- Oh, Jung-in, wait!

00:10:36.927 --> 00:10:38.763
[electronic voice] Door now closing.

00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:43.392

[music fades]

00:10:58.199 --> 00:11:00.034
[man] Are you free this weekend at all?

00:11:02.036 --> 00:11:03.663
Wanna go to a movie together?

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:06.707
Ah, just a moment.

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:12.505
Jung-in, hi.

00:11:12.588 --> 00:11:14.507
Hey, did you and I
make plans this weekend?

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:16.759
[Tae-ju] No. Why?

00:11:16.842 --> 00:11:19.512
Then I might go to a movie
in that case. Is that okay?

00:11:19.595 --> 00:11:21.514
Sure. Sounds fun.

00:11:22.473 --> 00:11:24.767
- What time are you going?
- I'm sorry, when is it?

00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:27.853
Uh, is five o'clock good for you?

00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:29.563
[Jung-in] Five o'clock.

00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:31.774
[Tae-ju] Should I book the tickets?
What are you seeing?

00:11:31.857 --> 00:11:32.775
What are we watching?

00:11:35.152 --> 00:11:36.904
Ah, this is my boyfriend.

00:11:36.987 --> 00:11:39.865
Oh, no, no.
Then you better go with him instead.

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:43.160
[Jung-in] Oh. But it's all right.
He's far away at the moment.

00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:45.663
- Wanna say hello?
- Hello.

00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:47.832
Oh, right. Hello.

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:51.419
Hm. I'm going to a movie, then.

00:11:51.502 --> 00:11:52.753
[Tae-ju] Okay, sounds good.

00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:54.505
- [Jung-in] Okay.
- [Tae-ju] Have fun!

00:11:54.588 --> 00:11:55.423
Ciao.

00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:03.472
Are we still going?

00:12:04.014 --> 00:12:04.890
[man sighs]

00:12:06.684 --> 00:12:07.518
Hm.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.689
Say, "Ah." [chuckles]

00:12:12.356 --> 00:12:13.983
- Ah. [chuckles]
- Ah.

00:12:14.692 --> 00:12:16.610
Heading to you. [laughs]

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:22.408
Jeez.

00:12:23.033 --> 00:12:24.577
Mm, it's so good.

00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:26.996
- Want me to show you something cool?
- Sure.

00:12:32.543 --> 00:12:33.377
Boring, boring.

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:34.295
Seen it before.

00:12:34.837 --> 00:12:35.755
What else?

00:12:37.214 --> 00:12:38.257
[Tae-ju] Okay.

00:12:39.675 --> 00:12:40.676
Just watch.

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:44.805
[Jung-in laughs]

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:45.806
Whoa!

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:46.724
Right?

00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:48.309
It's all right, yeah.

00:12:48.392 --> 00:12:49.435
- [Tae-ju] Jung-in.
- Yeah?

00:12:49.518 --> 00:12:51.312
- [Tae-ju] I'll send it to you, catch it.
- Okay.

00:12:54.273 --> 00:12:55.107
Go!

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:58.652
Mine! [laughs]

00:12:58.736 --> 00:13:01.155
[both laugh]

00:13:01.238 --> 00:13:03.407
- Now it's your turn!
- Knock it off.

- [Hyun-soo] Ah, you scared me.

00:39:17.563 --> 00:39:18.564
Well, it's not him.

00:39:19.106 --> 00:39:20.483
How do you do know? Did you ask?

00:39:20.566 --> 00:39:21.776
My brother said so.

00:39:22.276 --> 00:39:24.653
Our mom's type O, brother is B, and I'm A.

00:39:24.737 --> 00:39:26.405
Meaning Dad can't be type A.

00:39:27.198 --> 00:39:30.159
Your brother and you,
you might have different dads.

00:39:31.202 --> 00:39:32.036
[Hyun-soo] Oh?

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:35.289
Why would you just assume
that you have the same dad?

00:39:36.874 --> 00:39:39.251
- Oh, you're right.
- Of course.

00:39:40.002 --> 00:39:41.420
Now I'm confused.

00:39:44.048 --> 00:39:45.299
Just talk to him and ask.

00:39:45.383 --> 00:39:46.717
[sighs] I don't wanna.

00:39:46.801 --> 00:39:47.635
Why not?

00:39:48.636 --> 00:39:50.888
You make a habit
of digging into someone's life?

00:39:51.389 --> 00:39:54.141
What you just described
is the exact business we're in.

00:39:54.225 --> 00:39:56.727
- [man] Thank you.
- [sighs] Whatever.

00:39:56.811 --> 00:39:58.854
I'm hungry. I want jjamppong.

00:39:58.938 --> 00:40:00.481
Jajangmyeon's great here.

00:40:00.564 --> 00:40:01.524
I don't want it.

00:40:01.607 --> 00:40:03.818
Hey, their jajangmyeon is delicious,
just get it.

00:40:03.901 --> 00:40:07.321
Ugh, we also had jajangmyeon last time.
I want jjamppong.

00:40:09.031 --> 00:40:10.825
All right, fine. We're ready!

00:40:11.867 --> 00:40:12.701
[woman] Yes?

00:40:13.619 --> 00:40:14.620
[Hae-ri sighs]

00:40:17.206 --> 00:40:19.834
Oh? You're Jin-gu's grandma!

00:40:21.252 --> 00:40:22.586
I didn't know you worked here.

00:40:23.087 --> 00:40:25.840
I know. I just started here recently.

00:40:25.923 --> 00:40:28.843
Oh, so you must have left your last job,
then, is that right?

00:40:29.343 --> 00:40:32.805
Oh, no, I still work there,
and I also work here too.

00:40:32.888 --> 00:40:35.015
Oh. That must be tiring.

00:40:35.099 --> 00:40:38.727
Oh, no, it's... it's all right. [chuckles]
What can I get you?

00:40:38.811 --> 00:40:41.564
Uh, I'll have the jajangmyeon,
and a jjamppong for him.

00:40:41.647 --> 00:40:44.316
Oh, uh, jajangmyeon for me too.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:47.194
- [woman] Okay. I'll bring them out.
- Thanks.

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:51.824
MONTHLY PURCHASE

00:40:51.907 --> 00:40:53.284
[Hyun-soo] She's bought so much.

00:40:53.367 --> 00:40:56.537
[inhales sharply] If she keeps this up,
he'll just ask for more.

00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:02.918
So, uh, I just...
I just bought him a new car recently.

00:41:03.002 --> 00:41:05.463
But he says
he really doesn't like it very much.

00:41:07.631 --> 00:41:10.050
Could you possibly peek at it, just once?

00:41:10.134 --> 00:41:14.180
I thought that it looked nice,
but I don't know that much about cars.

00:41:17.808 --> 00:41:19.351
Hi, Jin-gu, honey.

00:41:19.435 --> 00:41:22.521
What is it now?
Just be quick, I'm too busy for this.

00:41:23.022 --> 00:41:24.857
[woman] Do you like the car, Jin-gu?

00:41:25.399 --> 00:41:26.984
[Jin-gu] No. It's awful.

00:41:28.068 --> 00:41:28.986
Do you think so?

00:41:30.488 --> 00:41:33.699
[Jin-gu] It's not nice at all.
It's so tacky. I'm not driving it.

00:41:33.782 --> 00:41:35.784
All right, I mean, well, then...

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:38.621
What do you want?
Should I buy you a new one?

00:41:38.704 --> 00:41:42.124
[Jin-gu] Yeah, yeah, sure. I'm busy.
I need to get to rehearsals. Gotta go.

00:41:42.208 --> 00:41:43.459
You're going on stage?

00:41:45.503 --> 00:41:47.755
[Jin-gu] Yeah, I already told you
I was in a show.

00:41:48.339 --> 00:41:52.009
Oh, then, does that mean I can see it too?

00:41:52.092 --> 00:41:53.677
Grandma, of course you can't.

00:41:54.970 --> 00:41:56.430
Ah, I see.

00:41:57.348 --> 00:41:58.349
Well, all right, then.

00:41:59.683 --> 00:42:02.520
Make sure you take photos
to show me later, okay?

00:42:02.603 --> 00:42:04.730
Fine, yeah, whatever.

00:42:04.813 --> 00:42:06.148
Okay.

00:42:06.232 --> 00:42:09.693
Grandma, by the way, I need a piano
so I can practice for the play.

00:42:10.778 --> 00:42:13.572
Oh, oh, oh, okay, a piano.

00:42:14.073 --> 00:42:17.159
- All right, bye.
- [woman] Oh, okay, yeah, all right.

00:42:18.285 --> 00:42:22.957
Uh, so, do you think getting
a bigger car for him is a good idea?

00:42:24.583 --> 00:42:28.879
Uh, we can trade it in
for a new and bigger one at no charge.

00:42:30.464 --> 00:42:34.051
[laughs] In that case,
dumplings are on me.

00:42:34.843 --> 00:42:38.722
[chuckles] You are so generous.
Thank you so much.

00:42:38.806 --> 00:42:41.267
[woman laughs, sighs]

00:42:43.769 --> 00:42:44.645
[Hyun-soo] Hm.

00:42:45.396 --> 00:42:46.897
Did he always act like this?

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.527
[Hyun-soo] She's going
to spoil him rotten.

00:42:58.659 --> 00:42:59.743
[Hyun-soo sighs]

00:43:02.663 --> 00:43:05.165
[clears throat] H-Hello, I, uh... I, uh,

00:43:06.375 --> 00:43:07.418
brought these...

00:43:07.501 --> 00:43:08.335
[scoffs]

00:43:31.567 --> 00:43:32.818
Mr. Kim!

00:43:32.901 --> 00:43:35.029
- Oh!
- [man laughs]

00:43:35.112 --> 00:43:36.739
- Hey, son?
- [young man] Yeah, Dad?

00:43:36.822 --> 00:43:38.073
Show Mr. Kim inside.

00:43:38.157 --> 00:43:39.283
Ah, hello.

00:43:39.867 --> 00:43:42.202
This was my father's dying wish so...

00:43:42.286 --> 00:43:43.203
[Mr. Kim] Oh, I see.

00:43:44.038 --> 00:43:46.040
- You're doing well?
- Oh, I'm great.

00:43:46.123 --> 00:43:47.916
- You should join me.
- [Mr. Kim] I'd rather not.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.251
- Right this way.
- Mm.

00:43:49.335 --> 00:43:52.087
- My, you're balding! [laughs]
- [Mr. Kim] No, I'm not!

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:54.798
- Hey, punk.
- [man yelps]

00:43:56.467 --> 00:43:58.886
Wasn't sure you'd be here today.
[chuckles]

00:43:58.969 --> 00:44:01.513
- Oh, Yong-sik.
- Glad you're here.

00:44:01.597 --> 00:44:03.641
You owe me five million won still.

00:44:03.724 --> 00:44:07.186
Oh, right, of course. I'll pay it.

00:44:15.903 --> 00:44:17.529
Thank you for being here today.

00:44:22.618 --> 00:44:23.494

[quirky music plays]

00:44:29.041 --> 00:44:31.710
[laughs awkwardly] I was...
Uh, sorry, never mind.

00:44:31.794 --> 00:44:33.671

Kim Hyun-soo, remember?

00:44:49.436 --> 00:44:51.271
Ah, right. We met.

00:44:51.355 --> 00:44:54.233
I was calling to see how you are.
Been well there?

00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:56.485
It's all great here.

00:44:56.568 --> 00:44:57.736

[Hyun-soo laughs nervously]

00:45:14.878 --> 00:45:16.714
Then I'm gonna go.

00:45:17.423 --> 00:45:18.590
Yeah, all right.

00:45:20.467 --> 00:45:21.635
[Yong-sik] Okay, bye!

00:45:22.428 --> 00:45:24.221
Hey, sir, hold up.

00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:26.473
Uh, would you like to...

00:45:28.642 --> 00:45:30.310
to try out some games real quick?

You can call tomorrow. Okay?

00:46:03.719 --> 00:46:06.221
[Bai Li] Mom, wait!
Don't hang up yet. Let's talk.

00:46:07.181 --> 00:46:09.767
I wanna thank you for taking care of Jia

00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:12.311

00:46:12.394 --> 00:46:15.481
You're making it possible
to chase after my dreams like this.

00:46:17.649 --> 00:46:18.525
Thank you, Mom.

00:46:19.735 --> 00:46:22.529
I went shopping
for some souvenirs to bring home,

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:25.866
but I'm having trouble
finding something you'd like.

00:46:25.949 --> 00:46:27.284
What about this?

00:46:28.994 --> 00:46:31.538
Pretty, don't you think? Color's nice.

00:46:31.622 --> 00:46:34.708
What about your friends?
I can go buy some more. How's that?

00:46:34.792 --> 00:46:38.045
Just make sure you tell them your daughter
was the one that bought them.

00:46:39.755 --> 00:46:40.631
Hm?

00:46:41.757 --> 00:46:43.967
[mom] Don't buy it. I don't need it.

00:46:45.636 --> 00:46:49.598
I don't mind. Or is it not their style?
I can go look for another col...

00:47:41.608 --> 00:47:44.403
Well, I'd like to...
to cancel the service, please.

00:47:46.113 --> 00:47:49.825
Well, it... it all just feels so awkward.

00:47:50.909 --> 00:47:53.203
I'm just going
to tell the child the truth.

00:47:54.121 --> 00:47:57.958
So I'd like to stop the service
at the end of this month.

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:02.838
Yes. Yes, of course. I, uh...

00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:04.756
I understand, yes.

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:07.092

How are you?

00:48:45.923 --> 00:48:46.757
[Bai Li] Good.

00:48:52.137 --> 00:48:54.097
[sighs] Actually, not good.

00:48:55.682 --> 00:48:57.392

00:49:00.771 --> 00:49:01.605
Why?

[Bai Li] Mm.

00:49:03.982 --> 00:49:05.859
She's not telling me something.

00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:11.448
Why are parents
never honest with their kids?

00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:14.618
I don't know.

00:49:16.078 --> 00:49:17.579
I don't have a parent.

00:49:20.707 --> 00:49:21.541
Sorry.

Tae-ju went there

He was looking for...

That's what it was.

01:05:36.265 --> 01:05:37.683
Never mind. I'm sorry.

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:41.228
[door opens]

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:43.522
[door closes]

01:05:47.652 --> 01:05:53.157
[cell phone rings]

01:05:54.742 --> 01:05:56.494
[cell phone continues ringing]

01:05:57.161 --> 01:06:02.208
TAE-JU

01:06:02.708 --> 01:06:03.793
Jung-in.

01:06:03.876 --> 01:06:06.796
You're out walking, right?
I can see you from way out here.

01:06:07.964 --> 01:06:09.882
Thinking about me on your way to work?

01:06:13.219 --> 01:06:14.053
You know,

01:06:15.513 --> 01:06:17.974
Earth is looking
especially bright and blue today.

01:06:19.141 --> 01:06:19.976
Isn't it?

01:06:24.605 --> 01:06:26.190
It's the same as yesterday.

01:06:28.067 --> 01:06:28.901
Hey,

01:06:29.694 --> 01:06:32.071
it's completely different
than it was yesterday.

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:34.573
I'll show you tomorrow's Earth too.

01:06:35.866 --> 01:06:38.536
Have a great day.
A safe flight, too, okay?

01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:45.459
[sports commentator] Has the ball.
And he shoots, he scores!

01:06:45.543 --> 01:06:48.421
[all cheer]

01:06:48.504 --> 01:06:50.756
[sports commentator] Amazing play!

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.842
[melancholy music plays]

01:07:12.403 --> 01:07:13.696
[inaudible speech]

01:07:13.779 --> 01:07:15.781
[melancholy music continues]

01:07:31.422 --> 01:07:32.256
[music fades]

01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:38.596
[sirens wail]

01:07:41.348 --> 01:07:43.976
[firefighter] Yes, over here.
Over here! Let's do this!

01:07:44.685 --> 01:07:45.561
[Jung-in] Excuse me!

01:07:48.314 --> 01:07:49.315
[firefighter] Understood.

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:54.070
You can't go in, Miss.

01:07:54.153 --> 01:07:56.072
- Just a minute, I need to go.
- You can't go.

01:07:56.155 --> 01:07:58.574
- No, there's someone in there, let go!
- Please wait outside.

01:07:58.657 --> 01:07:59.950
Wait, there's someone inside!

01:08:01.243 --> 01:08:03.996
[detective] The fire started
as soon as Tae-ju walked out.

01:08:04.497 --> 01:08:06.082
Doesn't that seem strange?

01:08:07.374 --> 01:08:09.418
It doesn't. That's not strange at all.

01:08:12.338 --> 01:08:15.007
[detective] You know Park Tae-ju well,
isn't that right?

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:17.593
Yeah, so?

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:20.930
Did he seem like his normal self lately?

01:08:21.013 --> 01:08:23.015
[melancholy music plays]

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:29.146
He's been great.

01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:31.107
Normal, as always.

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:39.782
Like I just told you, Tae-ju didn't do it.

01:08:41.659 --> 01:08:42.493
All right, then.

01:08:46.205 --> 01:08:48.165
[Jung-in] You should've been more careful.

01:08:48.249 --> 01:08:49.708
[Tae-ju] I didn't do anything.

01:08:52.461 --> 01:08:53.462
Were you cooking?

01:08:54.922 --> 01:08:56.924
[melancholy music continues]

01:08:59.218 --> 01:09:00.636
No, I'm telling the truth.

01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:03.264
[Jung-in] Oh, yeah?

01:09:05.558 --> 01:09:08.394
If you didn't do anything,
how'd the fire start?

01:09:09.478 --> 01:09:10.563
Jung-in.

01:09:10.646 --> 01:09:12.648
[melancholy music continues]

01:09:26.287 --> 01:09:28.497
[Jung-in sighs] Where do we sleep tonight?

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:33.335
[Tae-ju] Should we... go on a trip?

01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:37.673
[Jung-in] I've got a flight tomorrow.
To Barcelona.

01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:40.092
That'll be great.

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:42.678
You like it there.

01:09:44.889 --> 01:09:45.723
[Jung-in sighs]

01:09:46.974 --> 01:09:49.185
[Jung-in] Nothing
about any of this is great.

01:09:49.935 --> 01:09:52.021
[yells] Seriously.

01:09:53.939 --> 01:09:54.899
[Jung-in sighs]

01:09:56.734 --> 01:09:57.568
[Jung-in cries]

01:10:00.112 --> 01:10:02.198
[Jung-in breathes deeply]

01:10:02.281 --> 01:10:04.283
[melancholy music continues]

01:10:07.369 --> 01:10:08.329
[music fades]

01:10:29.850 --> 01:10:32.436
Grandma, hey. I've been busy, so I...

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:35.606
What the... Who are you?

01:10:37.024 --> 01:10:40.653
I am the Wonderland service manager,
Seo Hae-ri. We met earlier.

01:10:41.278 --> 01:10:42.446
What do you want?

01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:45.115
I'm afraid it's something
about your grandmother.

01:10:45.616 --> 01:10:46.575
What is it?

01:10:47.326 --> 01:10:49.286
She hasn't been answering my calls.

01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:51.830
She didn't get the ski gear she promised.
I was so embarrassed.

01:10:53.415 --> 01:10:55.292
Jin-gu, I'm sorry to inform you that...

01:10:57.670 --> 01:10:59.296
What is it? Spit it out already.

01:11:00.965 --> 01:11:02.716
She passed away earlier today.

01:11:06.178 --> 01:11:07.096
I'm very sorry.

01:11:10.432 --> 01:11:13.102
She collapsed
on her way to work this morning.

01:11:13.769 --> 01:11:16.146
Your Wonderland service
will now be terminated.

01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:20.859
Your records will be safely stored by us
until a new request is made.

01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:23.237
I wish you the very best.

01:11:24.697 --> 01:11:26.323
And to your grandmother as well.

01:11:27.074 --> 01:11:29.076
[somber music plays]

01:11:43.090 --> 01:11:43.966
[music fades]

01:11:44.591 --> 01:11:47.261
[PA system] Attention, please.
This is the final call.

01:11:47.344 --> 01:11:53.934
[indistinct announcement continues]

01:11:56.437 --> 01:11:59.106
Attention, please. This is the final call.

01:12:05.696 --> 01:12:10.159
Ah! Oh, yes, can you tell me
where gate 55 is? I'm a bit lost.

01:12:10.868 --> 01:12:13.037
[woman] Ah, you see that over there?

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.997
- Uh-huh.
- [woman] It's just on the right.

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:16.874
- Thank you.
- [woman] Oh, you're welcome.

01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:24.465
Huh?

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:26.842
Jia!

01:12:27.926 --> 01:12:28.761
Jia!

01:12:28.844 --> 01:12:30.804
[tense music plays]

01:12:32.014 --> 01:12:32.848
[gasps]

01:12:33.682 --> 01:12:34.808
Jia!

01:12:34.892 --> 01:12:38.354
I'm s... I'm sorry. Sorry! [panting] Jia!

01:12:38.437 --> 01:12:43.192
Sir, over here! Sir! Sir, this way!
Sir, my granddaughter has disappeared!

01:12:43.776 --> 01:12:45.736
I need help, sir. Help me, please!

01:12:45.819 --> 01:12:49.156
[PA system] A young girl has gone missing
in the airport.

01:12:49.698 --> 01:12:51.158
Her name is Bai Jia.

01:12:51.241 --> 01:12:55.162
She is seven years old
and she is wearing a brown trench coat.

01:12:55.245 --> 01:12:59.291
If you have seen this girl,
please speak to a police officer

01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:02.753
or contact the information desk
as soon as possible.

01:13:02.836 --> 01:13:04.380
- [cell phone rings]
- [Bai Li] Mom.

01:13:04.963 --> 01:13:05.798
Where's Jia?

01:13:06.465 --> 01:13:08.258
Vanished! She's just disappeared!

01:13:09.093 --> 01:13:10.010
What?

01:13:10.594 --> 01:13:11.595
She vanished?

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:15.474
How'd that happen?

01:13:16.308 --> 01:13:18.560
- [whimpers]
- [Bai Li] I'm sure she's fine, Mom.

01:13:18.644 --> 01:13:20.813
Try not to worry. Did you tell the police?

01:13:21.855 --> 01:13:23.732
Did the airport make an announcement?

01:13:24.316 --> 01:13:28.237
Also, what was Jia wearing today?
And when did you guys arrive?

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:30.823
I told you it was a bad idea
to move back to China.

01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:34.159
What did the police say?
Why aren't you saying anything?

01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:35.244
Mom?

01:13:35.327 --> 01:13:36.161
Mom!

01:13:36.995 --> 01:13:38.288
- Mom!
- Bai Li!

01:13:40.374 --> 01:13:42.167
Why'd you keep on calling me that?

01:13:49.299 --> 01:13:53.345
YOUR SERVICE HAS BEEN DEACTIVATED

01:14:07.401 --> 01:14:08.235
Jung-in.

01:14:08.861 --> 01:14:10.988
- Hello, welcome.
- Hello, sir.

01:14:11.864 --> 01:14:13.282
[Tae-ju] I want to go with you.

01:14:17.536 --> 01:14:19.163
[Jung-in] Let's talk over here.

01:14:25.836 --> 01:14:28.630
We'll eat some good food
and take lots of pictures.

01:14:29.214 --> 01:14:33.051
- [man] Jung-in, we'll head inside first.
- Sure, I'll be right there.

01:14:35.637 --> 01:14:36.513
[sighs]

01:14:37.097 --> 01:14:38.765
We can't go on a trip right now.

01:14:40.893 --> 01:14:42.936
You're not back to normal, okay?

01:14:43.437 --> 01:14:45.022
Don't worry, I'm fine now.

01:14:46.398 --> 01:14:48.984
You're not. You're not okay just yet.

01:14:49.985 --> 01:14:50.944
Let's talk later.

01:14:52.404 --> 01:14:53.405
Just tell me.

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:56.325
- [Jung-in] I need to go in now.
- [Tae-ju] Are you avoiding me?

01:14:56.825 --> 01:14:57.910
I'm not doing that.

01:14:57.993 --> 01:15:03.665
[cell phone rings]

01:15:05.834 --> 01:15:06.752
[ringing stops]

01:15:11.006 --> 01:15:12.257
Who keeps calling you?

01:15:12.841 --> 01:15:17.930
[cell phone rings]

01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:21.475
[Tae-ju] Answer it.

01:15:24.686 --> 01:15:25.521
Jung-in.

01:15:25.604 --> 01:15:30.359
[cell phone continues ringing]

01:15:31.568 --> 01:15:37.032
[cell phone continues ringing]

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:39.451
You answer it.

01:15:41.787 --> 01:15:44.039
[cell phone continues ringing]

01:15:44.122 --> 01:15:47.918
TAE-JU

01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:52.714
[cell phone continues ringing]

01:15:53.465 --> 01:15:55.551
Jung-in, safe travels today.

01:15:56.301 --> 01:15:57.803
Hm? Who are you?

01:16:06.728 --> 01:16:07.563
Hello?

01:16:08.105 --> 01:16:09.189
- Hello?
- Sorry.

01:16:09.273 --> 01:16:10.816
[melancholy music plays]

01:16:17.656 --> 01:16:19.366
I just missed you so much.

01:16:24.037 --> 01:16:25.956
Okay, let's go together.

01:16:27.666 --> 01:16:29.126
I'll tell you about it there.

01:17:09.833 --> 01:17:12.919
- [stewardess] Sir, please remain seated.
- [steward] Sir, we're about to take off.

01:17:15.839 --> 01:17:16.757
[Jung-in] Tae-ju, wait!

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:18.842
[melancholy music continues]

01:17:28.393 --> 01:17:29.394
Travel safe, okay?

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:31.688
[melancholy music continues]

01:18:05.222 --> 01:18:06.223
[music fades]

01:18:08.058 --> 01:18:09.226
[Jia] Mama.

01:18:13.021 --> 01:18:15.399
[echoing] I found you!

01:18:15.482 --> 01:18:16.817
[birds chirp]

01:18:19.945 --> 01:18:22.989
[echoing] You're right under there!

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:25.534
[Bai Li] Jia.

01:18:27.119 --> 01:18:29.371
[sighs] I had such a scary dream.

01:18:29.871 --> 01:18:32.791
I was in the desert,
and my baby had somehow vanished.

01:18:32.874 --> 01:18:35.711
[Jia] Are you crying, Mama?
You can cry, I'm here.

01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:39.256
I'm gonna hide really well, okay?
I'll go hide now.

01:18:40.757 --> 01:18:44.553
[breathes shakily]

01:18:45.637 --> 01:18:46.680
Wait, Jia!

01:18:46.763 --> 01:18:48.390
[Bai Li panting]

01:18:52.436 --> 01:18:56.314
[echoing] Mama, I found you!

01:18:56.398 --> 01:18:57.899
[birds squawk]

01:19:00.527 --> 01:19:03.447
[Jia, echoing] Mama, come and find me!

01:19:03.530 --> 01:19:04.364
Please, Jia.

01:19:06.992 --> 01:19:08.869
[Jia, echoing] Mama!

01:19:09.536 --> 01:19:10.871
[gasps] Wait, Jia!

01:19:11.705 --> 01:19:12.831
Jia!

[tense music plays]

01:19:17.210 --> 01:19:19.087
Wait, Jia!

01:19:23.633 --> 01:19:24.468
[music stops]

01:19:36.730 --> 01:19:40.484
[answerphone] The person you called
is unavailable. At the tone, please...

01:19:41.067 --> 01:19:44.863
[cell phone dials]

01:19:44.946 --> 01:19:46.364
Is something wrong?

01:19:47.324 --> 01:19:49.034
- Jia is missing.
- What...

01:19:49.534 --> 01:19:50.744
W-W-What do you mean?

01:19:51.411 --> 01:19:53.455
- [static sound]
- How did she go missing? Hey, Danny!

01:19:53.955 --> 01:19:55.040
Where are you going?

01:19:55.123 --> 01:19:57.125

[tense music plays]

01:20:02.339 --> 01:20:04.049
[sighs] I've stayed here too long.

01:20:04.591 --> 01:20:06.927
- What do you mean?
- How are you gonna go?

01:20:07.844 --> 01:20:08.762
[man] Bai Li!

01:20:08.845 --> 01:20:10.472
You can't just leave like this!

01:20:10.555 --> 01:20:12.557
[man] It looks like the Tree of Life!

01:20:12.641 --> 01:20:14.935
- [woman] Huh?
- It looks like the Tree of Life.

01:20:15.018 --> 01:20:15.852
Hey!

01:20:15.936 --> 01:20:17.813
[tense music continues]

I-Is she going somewhere?

01:20:19.397 --> 01:20:21.441
I don't know what happened to her.

01:22:38.536 --> 01:22:40.538

No.

Do you think this is real?

01:25:19.823 --> 01:25:20.907

[man] Bai Li!

- [Bai Li] My father's name is Bai.
- [man] The Tree of Life!

01:26:05.952 --> 01:26:07.370
[Bai Li] And my mom's is Li.

01:26:08.496 --> 01:26:10.248
My daughter doesn't know anything.

01:26:11.332 --> 01:26:13.209
I always wanted to be her friend.

01:26:14.127 --> 01:26:15.086
But I failed.

01:26:16.337 --> 01:26:21.009
Actually, my mother didn't wanna do it,
but I persuaded her.

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:25.847
You said that, when I'm there,
I won't know that I died, right?

01:26:29.601 --> 01:26:32.020
I want to try again when I go there.

01:26:33.146 --> 01:26:35.315
Thank you. That was my dream.

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:42.530
[Hyun-soo] I think we need to erase
all of Bai Li's data.

01:26:42.614 --> 01:26:44.782
At this rate,
it could destroy the entire system.

01:26:45.283 --> 01:26:46.201
I'll erase it.

[Hae-ri] And if her family wants her back?

01:26:55.293 --> 01:26:56.961
[Hyun-soo] We can make her again.

01:26:59.214 --> 01:27:01.883
[Hae-ri] If we remake her,
she won't be the same person.

01:27:05.053 --> 01:27:06.221
What do you mean?

01:27:08.306 --> 01:27:09.724
That happened to my parents.

01:27:12.977 --> 01:27:15.146
I erased them and remade them once too.

In just the blink of an eye,

01:27:18.566 --> 01:27:20.526
everything that seemed real turns fake.

The system's shutting down.

01:28:44.485 --> 01:28:46.404
Why hasn't Bai Li's data been erased?

01:28:46.487 --> 01:28:47.488
Bai Li.

01:28:47.572 --> 01:28:49.782
I think there's something
that Bai Li wants.

01:28:49.866 --> 01:28:51.284
Something she wants?

01:28:52.076 --> 01:28:53.077
Something's different.

01:28:53.161 --> 01:28:54.871
Yeah, of course it is, it's an error.

01:28:56.039 --> 01:28:58.875
I don't think it is.
Open the network for her.

01:28:58.958 --> 01:29:00.251
What are you trying to do?

01:29:02.128 --> 01:29:03.087
Just do it.

Please don't hang up.

but I just feel like you can help me.

I'm looking for my kid.

Do you see a little girl around you?

01:30:44.105 --> 01:30:45.523
Tell her to stay there.

01:30:45.606 --> 01:30:46.691
I'm coming for her.

So, where were you trying to go anyway?

01:31:48.586 --> 01:31:49.629
To see Mama.

01:31:51.672 --> 01:31:52.548
Your mom, huh?

So, did you really
talk to my mama on the phone?

01:32:18.407 --> 01:32:19.242
Mm-hmm.

01:32:20.284 --> 01:32:22.119
She said that she's on her way here.

01:32:24.455 --> 01:32:26.874
She called and asked me
to tell you to wait for her.

01:32:28.584 --> 01:32:30.878
So I better wait right here then, right?

01:32:32.004 --> 01:32:33.005
[Tae-ju] Mm-hmm.

01:32:36.926 --> 01:32:38.010

My Jia! [cries]

Oh, honey, I worried
so much about you, Jia!

01:33:03.995 --> 01:33:04.829
Thank you.

01:33:07.039 --> 01:33:08.291
Say thank you, Jia.

01:33:08.374 --> 01:33:09.959
Thank you so much.

[grunts]

01:33:25.224 --> 01:33:28.436
[Jia] Mama told me
that I should wait right here for her.

01:33:31.606 --> 01:33:33.399
I want you to call Mama for me.

[Bai Li's mom]
Mama can't answer right now.

01:33:36.569 --> 01:33:38.696
I'll explain it all later, okay?

01:33:39.905 --> 01:33:41.949

Mama is

01:34:20.738 --> 01:34:22.657
at the airport right now, actually.

01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:23.699
[Jia] Really?

01:34:24.408 --> 01:34:25.826
But where, Mama?

01:34:29.121 --> 01:34:31.165
I can't see you anywhere.

Mama, where are you?

01:34:46.097 --> 01:34:47.765
Why can't I see you, Mama?

Mama.

01:35:01.862 --> 01:35:03.364
Mama is dead, honey.

01:35:30.224 --> 01:35:31.058
Well,

01:35:31.767 --> 01:35:34.562
can you still read three stories at night

01:35:34.645 --> 01:35:37.523
like you always do right before bedtime?

01:35:38.858 --> 01:35:40.860
[somber music continues]

01:35:46.741 --> 01:35:47.616
[sniffs] Yes.

01:35:48.117 --> 01:35:49.243
Of course I can.

01:35:50.161 --> 01:35:51.537
But I don't know.

01:35:52.121 --> 01:35:54.415
Don't you think
we should read more than three?

01:35:54.498 --> 01:35:56.333
Say, six stories, okay?

01:35:56.417 --> 01:35:57.418

My Jia.

01:36:02.131 --> 01:36:04.717
I can really tell that you've grown.

01:36:05.718 --> 01:36:07.887
Now you really are a big girl.

01:36:08.387 --> 01:36:10.681
You'll be just fine on your own, right?

01:36:11.807 --> 01:36:12.850
You know what to do?

01:36:12.933 --> 01:36:14.477
I know, yeah.

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:18.189
I have to eat well,
and get lots of rest, and exercise.

01:36:18.856 --> 01:36:19.732
[Bai Li exhales]

01:36:20.524 --> 01:36:21.567

01:36:25.112 --> 01:36:26.530
Let me talk to your grandma.

01:36:28.032 --> 01:36:30.034
[gentle music continues]

01:36:36.999 --> 01:36:37.958
Hey.

01:36:39.835 --> 01:36:41.921
I'm doing well here, Mom.

01:36:43.088 --> 01:36:44.507
Mm-hmm. Mmm.

01:36:47.968 --> 01:36:49.345
I owe you a lot, don't I?

01:36:51.096 --> 01:36:51.931
Yeah.

01:36:52.932 --> 01:36:55.851
I'll return the favor one day. [chuckles]

01:36:56.727 --> 01:36:57.812
[cries softly]

01:36:58.479 --> 01:36:59.563
In the next life,

01:37:00.439 --> 01:37:02.525
I can be the mom and you the daughter.

01:37:02.608 --> 01:37:04.068
I'll take care of you then.

01:37:04.902 --> 01:37:06.904
I'll give you everything you could want.

01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:10.533
[cries]

01:37:10.616 --> 01:37:12.993
Oh, honey. [cries]

01:37:13.828 --> 01:37:15.287
[cries]

01:37:16.038 --> 01:37:16.872
Mom,

01:37:18.123 --> 01:37:19.875
take care of yourself, okay?

01:37:19.959 --> 01:37:21.043
[mom continues crying]

01:37:21.126 --> 01:37:24.255
So you have to eat well,
and get lots of rest, and exercise.

01:37:24.338 --> 01:37:25.798
[sobs]

01:37:26.715 --> 01:37:29.218
Bai Li, I'm going
to miss you, my daughter.

01:37:29.301 --> 01:37:30.594
[cries]

01:37:30.678 --> 01:37:32.680
[gentle music continues]

01:37:33.681 --> 01:37:36.767
Hey, we'll talk with each other tonight,
so please don't cry.

01:37:36.851 --> 01:37:38.352
Stop it, don't cry, don't cry.

01:37:38.435 --> 01:37:40.437
[gentle music continues]

01:37:41.689 --> 01:37:42.648
[breathes shakily]

01:37:42.731 --> 01:37:45.651
[Bai Li] Oh no, your gray hairs
are starting to show again.

01:37:46.318 --> 01:37:47.152
[sniffs]

01:37:48.195 --> 01:37:50.114
[Bai Li] Don't forget to dye it, okay?

01:37:50.698 --> 01:37:53.242
[breathes shakily]

01:37:53.325 --> 01:37:56.036
[Bai Li] I should be there
to do it for you, but I can't.

01:37:56.745 --> 01:37:58.664
- [cries]
- [Bai Li] Sorry.

01:37:59.206 --> 01:38:02.251
Please, it's... it's all right. [sniffles]

01:38:02.334 --> 01:38:04.336
[gentle music continues]

01:38:06.714 --> 01:38:08.632
Gotta get to work. Bye-bye!

01:38:10.384 --> 01:38:12.386
[gentle music continues]

01:38:17.683 --> 01:38:18.559

01:39:18.285 --> 01:39:20.287
[soft music continues]

01:39:22.039 --> 01:39:24.959
- [Hyun-soo exhales] We're back online.
- Yeah.

01:39:26.710 --> 01:39:27.962
Seems like you were right.

01:39:29.296 --> 01:39:30.255
It seems so.

01:39:31.131 --> 01:39:31.966
Yeah.

01:39:35.010 --> 01:39:36.929
I wonder what caused all that?

01:39:39.306 --> 01:39:40.307
[Hae-ri exhales]

01:39:41.266 --> 01:39:42.267

01:39:49.274 --> 01:39:50.693
[cell phone rings]

01:39:52.403 --> 01:39:53.821
[Hae-ri] Oh, hello, Miss Jung-in.

01:39:54.321 --> 01:39:56.240
[Jung-in] Hello, I'm calling to...

01:39:57.866 --> 01:40:00.202
Well, I think it's time
to cancel my service.

01:40:00.285 --> 01:40:02.705
[Hae-ri] Oh, did you encounter
any problems with the service?

01:40:03.247 --> 01:40:04.081
It's not that.

01:40:05.416 --> 01:40:06.375
Tae-ju is awake.

01:40:06.875 --> 01:40:07.710
[Hae-ri] What?

01:40:08.252 --> 01:40:09.294
Tae-ju, he

01:40:10.921 --> 01:40:12.089
came back.

01:40:13.298 --> 01:40:14.466
Oh, I see.

01:40:16.927 --> 01:40:18.095
Congratulations.

01:40:18.804 --> 01:40:22.349
Then, um, I'll terminate
the service for you then.

01:40:23.017 --> 01:40:23.851
Thanks.

01:40:26.687 --> 01:40:29.148
Oh, could I possibly ask you a big favor?

01:40:29.231 --> 01:40:31.567
[gentle music plays]

01:40:38.449 --> 01:40:40.451
Why did you choose space anyway?

01:40:45.789 --> 01:40:49.626
I guess it was just
the furthest kind of place I knew.

01:40:51.253 --> 01:40:53.005
Since you felt so far away.

01:40:54.214 --> 01:40:56.216
[gentle music continues]

01:41:10.647 --> 01:41:11.607
[Tae-ju] I should go.

01:41:14.693 --> 01:41:15.778
[music fades]

01:41:31.627 --> 01:41:33.295

01:41:33.378 --> 01:41:34.505
[Jung-in] Hey!

01:41:35.506 --> 01:41:37.007
[laughing] Jeez!

01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:40.219
- It got stuck. What do we do?
- [Jung-in] What are you doing?

01:41:40.886 --> 01:41:41.887
[Jung-in] Wow!

01:41:41.970 --> 01:41:44.765
- Ah, you big dummy. Big, big dummy.
- It got stuck.

01:41:44.848 --> 01:41:46.934
It's stuck. The kite's stuck in the tree.

01:41:48.143 --> 01:41:50.646
[both laugh]

01:41:51.230 --> 01:41:52.731
[Jung-in] You're climbing it?

01:41:53.315 --> 01:41:54.566
Wow!

01:41:55.609 --> 01:41:57.361
- Wow!
- [Tae-ju] I don't think I can.

01:41:57.444 --> 01:41:59.530
- Don't do it!
- [Jung-in laughs]

01:41:59.613 --> 01:42:01.156
[Tae-ju] Be careful! [laughs]

01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:03.534
- Tae-ju, I love you!
- Can't hear you.

01:42:03.617 --> 01:42:04.743
Tae-ju, I love you.

01:42:04.827 --> 01:42:05.786
Can't hear you!

01:42:06.411 --> 01:42:08.580
I can ride so good now, see?

01:42:09.456 --> 01:42:10.874
You can ride solo, now, huh?

01:42:10.958 --> 01:42:12.251
[both laugh]

01:42:12.334 --> 01:42:14.503
[Jung-in] No, we should
still ride together!

01:42:15.045 --> 01:42:18.006
You'll do fine on your own, right?
Just don't get sick.

01:42:18.090 --> 01:42:19.842
- [Jung-in laughs]
- You'll be all right.

01:42:19.925 --> 01:42:21.260
Hey, quit it!

01:42:21.343 --> 01:42:23.345

[hopeful music continues]

01:44:06.657 --> 01:44:07.491
Jung-in...

01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:11.078
I'm coming home now.

01:44:11.161 --> 01:44:13.163

Traveling alone?

01:45:08.051 --> 01:45:11.513
Yes. I just came back briefly
to see my family.

01:45:12.055 --> 01:45:13.140
But I have to go now.

01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:14.891
My work's waiting for me.

01:45:15.767 --> 01:45:17.227
- I see.
- [Bai Li chuckles softly]

01:45:17.311 --> 01:45:22.274
[PA system] Attention, please. This is
a final call for Luna Airlines flight 57.

01:45:22.357 --> 01:45:24.359
Are you going away for a long time?

01:45:24.443 --> 01:45:26.445
[gentle music plays]

01:45:29.072 --> 01:45:30.073

01:45:31.116 --> 01:45:32.034
Yes, like you.

01:45:33.744 --> 01:45:34.703
You know, right?

01:45:34.786 --> 01:45:36.788
[gentle music continues]

01:45:37.539 --> 01:45:38.457

01:45:39.833 --> 01:45:40.709
[chuckles]

01:45:45.047 --> 01:45:46.381
[in English] So you know Chinese.

01:45:47.716 --> 01:45:48.759
I do.

01:45:48.842 --> 01:45:50.844
[gentle music continues]

01:45:54.097 --> 01:45:55.891

to find your way around here.

01:47:18.890 --> 01:47:20.684
This place is so confusing!

01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:23.770
- [Hyun-soo] Mom!
- Oh, hi, honey! [laughs]

01:47:25.063 --> 01:47:27.065
Oh, little Kkomi!

01:47:27.149 --> 01:47:30.610
[gasps] Oh, you're so cute! Kkomi, hi!

01:47:30.694 --> 01:47:33.989
Kkomi, Kkomi. Yes, that's it!
[chuckles] Oh!

01:47:34.531 --> 01:47:37.951
Should I switch Kkomi
to your company instead?

01:47:38.034 --> 01:47:40.704
Mm-mm. I think pets do better
with their service.

01:47:40.787 --> 01:47:42.247
- Oh, okay.
- [cell phone rings]

01:47:42.330 --> 01:47:44.124
Kkomi, see you! [giggles]

Oh, hello, sir. Still doing all right?

01:47:49.504 --> 01:47:52.507
With that coupon you sent,
I had an amazing meal here.

01:47:52.591 --> 01:47:55.760
Ah, that's good to hear.
You should call me now and again.

01:47:55.844 --> 01:47:58.638
See, we, uh...
We employees get plenty of coupons.

01:47:58.722 --> 01:48:01.683
- Mm. Thank you.
- [Hyun-soo] Yeah. Oh, wait!

01:48:01.766 --> 01:48:04.269
I'd like to introduce you to my mom. Here.

Yes, that's right. It's me, Yong-sik.

01:48:13.820 --> 01:48:15.906
- What are you doing?
- [Yong-sik] Such a long time!

01:48:17.657 --> 01:48:19.826
He passed away.
He's using our service now.

01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:22.204
- [Yong-sik chuckles]
- [Hyun-soo] This is on Wonderland.

01:48:22.287 --> 01:48:25.749
[Yong-sik] My goodness, Gil-soon,
you haven't changed at all.

01:48:25.832 --> 01:48:26.750

01:48:27.667 --> 01:48:29.503
Uh, really? [chuckles]

01:48:29.586 --> 01:48:32.839
Well, then, uh, how has life turned out?

01:48:33.340 --> 01:48:34.633
How long has it been now?

01:48:35.175 --> 01:48:38.178
Goodness, it's so...
It's really great to see you. [chuckles]

01:48:38.261 --> 01:48:40.597
- Wow.
- I owe you an apology.

01:48:41.765 --> 01:48:42.933
[Yong-sik] Huh?

01:48:43.517 --> 01:48:45.644
[Gil-soon] For leaving you without a word.

01:48:46.686 --> 01:48:47.812
Ah.

01:48:47.896 --> 01:48:48.813
[Gil-soon sighs]

01:48:48.897 --> 01:48:51.024
- Is that how it went?
- [Gil-soon] Yes.

01:48:54.569 --> 01:48:56.446
Why don't you call sometime, huh?

01:48:57.197 --> 01:48:59.366
We can talk and try to catch up.
How's that sound?

01:48:59.449 --> 01:49:01.076
Oh, sure, of course.

01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:02.744
You take care, now.

01:49:02.827 --> 01:49:05.080
