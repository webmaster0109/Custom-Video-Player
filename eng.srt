00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,661
13 meters. You should see it.

2
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,717
Okay, take her up and over the bow rail.

3
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:19,515
<i>Mir 2, we're going over the bow.
Stay with us.</i>

4
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:55,718
Okay, quiet. We're rolling.

5
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:59,513
Seeing her coming out of the
darkness like a ghost ship...

6
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,432
...still gets me every time.

7
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:07,021
To see the sad ruin of the
great ship sitting here...

8
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,690
...where she landed at
2:30 in the morning

9
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:11,901
Of April 15, 1912

10
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,528
...after her long fall...

11
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:17,323
...from the world above.

12
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,408
You are so full of shit, boss.

13
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:53,609
Dive 6. Here we are again
on the deck of Titanic.

14
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:57,905
2% miles down
3,821 meters-

15
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,244
The pressure outside is 3% tons per square inch

16
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:05,746
These windows are
9 inches thick.

17
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:09,667
If they go, it's sayonara in two microseconds.

18
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,628
All right, enough of that bullshit.

19
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:29,979
Just put her down on the roof of
the officers' quarters like yesterday.

20
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:35,943
<i>Mir 2, we're landing right over the
Grand Staircase. You guys set to launch?</i>

21
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:39,697
Yeah, Brock. Launching Dunkin now.
Go, Charlie.

22
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,623
- All right, tether out.
- Tether out.

23
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:53,502
<i>Okay, Brock, we're dropping
down along the hull.</i>

24
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,134
Yeah, roger that- Okay, drop down and go
into the first class gangway door-

25
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,052
I want you guys working the D deck...

26
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:04,680
<i>...reception area and the dining saloon.</i>

27
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,473
<i>Copy that.</i>

28
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:15,858
Tether out. Okay, now left. Left, left.
Okay, coming left.

29
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:28,704
<i>Snoop Dog is on the move.
We're headed down the stairwell.</i>

30
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:33,292
Okay Lewis, drop down to B deck.

31
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,128
- Okay, A deck.
- Give me some rope, Captain.

32
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:37,963
B deck. Get in there. Get in there.

33
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:18,587
Watch the door frame.

34
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,422
- Watch it, watch it.
- I see it. I got it.

35
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,846
- We good? Bring her down.
- We're good. Just chill, boss.

36
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,446
Okay, make your turn.

37
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:47,199
- Cable out, Captain.
- Make your turn. Watch the wall.

38
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:49,827
Yeah Brock, we're at the piano.
You copy?

39
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:51,954
<i>Okay, copy that.</i>

40
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,547
Okay, right there. Right there.

41
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,340
Okay, that's it, that's it.
That's the bedroom door.

42
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,925
I see it. I see it.

43
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,102
We're in!

44
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,521
We're in, baby. We're there.

45
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:20,691
That's Hockley's bed.

46
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:22,818
That's where the
son of a bitch slept.

47
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,326
Oops. Somebody left the water running.

48
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,079
Hold it. Hold it just a second.
Go back to the right.

49
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:43,005
That wardrobe door.
Get closer.

50
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:44,756
You smelling something, boss?

51
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:48,177
- I want to see what's under it.
- Give me my hands, man.

52
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,184
All right.

53
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:58,770
- Take it easy. It might come apart.
- Okay.

54
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:03,442
Go, go, go. Flip it over.
Flip it over. Go.

55
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:05,402
Turn her over. Keep going.

56
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,778
Go, Q0, 9Â°-

57
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,197
Okay, drop it.

58
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:20,542
Oh, baby, baby.
Are you seeing this, boss?

59
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:25,464
It's payday, boys.

60
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,940
Cha-ching!

61
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,651
- We did it, Bobby.
- We brought it back, Baby.

62
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,987
Oh, yeah! Who's the best?
Who's the best, baby?

63
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,323
Say it. Say it. Say it.

64
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:53,325
You are, Lewis.

65
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:56,912
- Bobby, my cigar.
- Right here.

66
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:06,838
Okay, crack her open.

67
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:37,953
Shit.

68
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:41,707
No diamond.

69
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,462
You know boss, this same thing happened
to Geraldo and his career never recovered.

70
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,884
Turn the camera off.

71
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,721
Brock, the partners would like
to know how it's going.

72
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:01,226
Hey, Dave, Barry, hi. Look, I it wasn't
in the safe. But hey, hey...

73
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,063
...Don't worry about it. There's still
plenty of places it could be. Hell, yes.

74
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:07,858
The floor debris in the suite,
the mother's room...

75
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:08,942
the purser's safe on C deck.

76
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,319
Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase.

77
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:15,407
A dozen other places. Guys, look, you're just
going to have to trust my instincts. I know we're close.

78
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,993
We've just got to go through a little
process of elimination.

79
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,079
Hang on a second.

80
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,001
- Let me see that.
- Ah, we may have something here, guys.

81
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:31,590
Where's the photograph
of the necklace?

82
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,591
We'll call you right back.

83
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:46,438
I'll be goddamned.

84
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:52,861
<i>Treasure hunter Brock Lovett
is best known for finding Spanish gold...</i>

85
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,780
It's okay. I'll feed you in a minute.

86
00:10:55,113 --> 00:11:00,118
<i>Now he has chartered Russian subs to reach
the most famous shipwreck of all, the Titanic.</i>

87
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:04,289
<i>He is with us live via satellite
from the research ship Keldysh...</i>

88
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,708
<i>...in the North Atlantic. Hello, Brock.</i>

89
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,962
<i>Hello, Tracy. Of course, everyone knows
the familiar stories of Titanic.</i>

90
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:14,216
<i>You know, the nobility of the
band playing to the very end and all that.</i>

91
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:18,970
<i>But what I'm interested in are the untold stories.
The secrets locked deep inside the hull of Titanic.</i>

92
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:23,225
<i>And we're out here using robot
technology to go further into the wreck...</i>

93
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:25,143
<i>...than anybody has ever done before.</i>

94
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:28,647
<i>Your expedition is at the center
of a storm of controversy...</i>

95
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:32,901
<i>...over salvage rights and even ethics.
Many are calling you a graverobber.</i>

96
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,986
<i>Well, nobody ever called the
recovery of the artifacts...</i>

97
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:36,238
What is it?

98
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,156
Turn that up, dear.

99
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,159
<i>I have museum-trained experts
sent out here making sure...</i>

100
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,246
<i>---that these relics are preserved
and catalogued properly.</i>

101
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:47,082
<i>Take a look at this drawing
that we found just today.</i>

102
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:50,836
<i>A piece of paper that's been underwater
for 84 years.</i>

103
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,672
<i>And my team are able to
preserve it intact.</i>

104
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:57,342
<i>Should this have remained unseen
at the bottom of the ocean for eternity...</i>

105
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,594
<i>...when we can see and enjoy it now?</i>

106
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:01,680
I'll be goddamned.

107
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,101
Brock!

108
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,353
There's a satellite call for you.

109
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:11,940
Bobby, we're launching. You see
these submersibles going in the water?

110
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,609
Trust me, buddy.
You want to take this call.

111
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,779
This better be good.

112
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:20,782
Now, you gotta speak up.
She's kind of old.

113
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,200
Great.

114
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:26,455
This is Brock Lovett.
How can I help you, Mrs...?

115
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,832
Calvert. Rose Calvert.

116
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:29,833
Mrs. Calvert.

117
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:33,795
I was just wondering if you had found...

118
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,047
...the "Heart of the Ocean" yet, Mr. Lovett.

119
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,135
Told you you wanted to take the call.

120
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:45,390
All right, you have my
attention, Rose.

121
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:47,976
Can you tell us who the woman
in the picture is?

122
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:51,730
Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.

123
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:12,334
She's a goddamn liar!
Some nutcase seeking money or publicity.

124
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:16,421
God only knows why.
Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia.

125
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,590
They're inbound!

126
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:27,516
Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the
Titanic when she was 17, right?

127
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:31,269
- That's right.
- If she had lived, she'd be over 100 by now.

128
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:33,772
101 next month.

129
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,942
Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.

130
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,361
Look, I've already done the
background on this woman...

131
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:43,448
...all the way back to the 20s,
when she was working as an actress.

132
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:46,618
An actress.
There's your first clue, Sherlock.

133
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:51,248
Her name was Rose Dawson back then.
Then she marries this guy named Calvert.

134
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:54,793
They move to Cedar Rapids
and she punches out a couple of kids.

135
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:58,296
Now Calvert's dead
and, from what I hear, Cedar Rapids is dead.

136
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:00,882
And everybody who knows about the
diamond is supposed to be dead...

137
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,093
...or on this boat,
but she knows.

138
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,067
Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?

139
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:20,485
Hurry up, give him a hand.

140
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:24,906
Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.
Welcome to the Keldysh.

141
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,994
Okay, let's get her inside there.

142
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:30,495
Hi, Miss Calvert.

143
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,747
- Hi.
- Welcome to the Keldysh.

144
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:34,833
Thanks.

145
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:37,502
Hey!

146
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,178
Are your staterooms
all right?

147
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:48,305
Oh, yes.

148
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:49,347
Very nice.

149
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,725
Have you met my
granddaughter, Lizzy?

150
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,310
She takes care of me.

151
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:56,438
We met just a few
minutes ago.

152
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:57,647
Remember, Nana?
Up on deck?

153
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,024
Oh, yes.

154
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,610
There. That's nice.

155
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:04,696
Have to have my
pictures when I travel.

156
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:05,780
Can I get you anything?

157
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,032
Is there anything you'd like?

158
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:09,784
Yes.

159
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:12,621
I would like to
see my drawing.

160
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:29,387
Louis XVI wore a fabulous
stone that was...

161
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,181
...called the Blue Diamond
of the Crown...

162
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:34,142
...which disappeared
in 1792...

163
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:38,063
...about the same time old Louis lost
everything from the neck up.

164
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:42,150
The theory goes that the
crown diamond was chopped, too.

165
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,653
Recut into a heart-like shape that
became known as...

166
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:46,863
...the Heart of the Ocean.

167
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:49,741
Today it would be worth
more than the Hope diamond.

168
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,160
It was a dreadful,
heavy thing.

169
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:54,496
I only wore it this once.

170
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,082
You actually think
this is you, Nana?

171
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:59,209
It is me, dear.

172
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,211
Wasn't I a dish?

173
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,924
I tracked it down
through insurance records.

174
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:09,928
An old claim that was settled
under terms of absolute secrecy.

175
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,682
Can you tell me who the
claimant was, Rose?

176
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:16,601
I should imagine someone
named Hockley.

177
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,645
Nathan Hockley,
that's right.

178
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,106
Pittsburgh steel tycoon.

179
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:23,817
The claim was for a
diamond necklace his son...

180
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,276
...Caledon, bought his fiancÃ©e.

181
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:26,695
You.

182
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,364
A week before he
sailed on Titanic.

183
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,701
And it was filed right
after the sinking.

184
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,621
So the diamond had to have
gone down with the ship.

185
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,207
You see the date?

186
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:42,711
April 14, 1912

187
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,880
Which means if your grandmother
is who she says she is...

188
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:48,800
...she was wearing the diamond
the day the Titanic sank.

189
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:52,178
And that makes you
my new best friend.

190
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,181
These are some of the things
we recovered from your stateroom.

191
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:00,562
This was mine.

192
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,898
How extraordinary.

193
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:07,986
And it looks the same as it
did the last time I saw it.

194
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:16,244
The reflection has
changed a bit.

195
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:35,430
Are you ready to go
back to Titanic?

196
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,185
Okay, here we go.

197
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:43,563
She hits the berg on
the starboard side, right?

198
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:44,647
She kind of bumps along...

199
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:45,899
...punching holes like
morse code...

200
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:47,525
-- dit-dit-dit -- along the side...

201
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:48,610
...below the waterline.

202
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:52,280
Then the forward compartments
start to flood.

203
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,782
Now, as the water
level rises...

204
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,658
...it spills over the
watertight bulkheads...

205
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:58,703
which, unfortunately, don't go
any higher than E deck-

206
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,371
So now as the
bow goes down...

207
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:03,208
...the stern rises up,
slow at first...

208
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,793
...then faster and faster...

209
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:07,295
...until finally, she's got her whole
ass sticking up in the air.

210
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:09,339
And that's a big ass.

211
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:12,300
We're talking
20, 30,000 tons. Okay?

212
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,719
And the hull's not designed
to deal with that pressure.

213
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,429
So, what happens?

214
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:18,681
She splits, right
down to the keel.

215
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:19,682
And the stern...

216
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:21,226
...falls back level.

217
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:22,310
Then...

218
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,394
...as the bow sinks...

219
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,396
...it pulls the stern vertical...

220
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,565
...and then finally detaches.

221
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:31,653
Now the stern section just kind of bobs
there like a cork for a couple of minutes...

222
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:35,073
...floods, and finally goes
under about 2:20 AM...

223
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,492
...2 hours and 40 minutes
after the collision.

224
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,328
The bow section
planes away...

225
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,289
...landing about a
half a mile away...

226
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,375
...going 20, 30 knots when
it hits the ocean floor.

227
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,256
Pretty cool, huh?

228
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:55,844
Thank you for that fine
forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.

229
00:18:56,678 --> 00:19:00,014
Of course, the
experience of it was...

230
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:02,517
...somewhat different.

231
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,019
Will you share it with us?

232
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,075
I'm taking her to rest.

233
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,160
No.

234
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,494
Come on, Nana.

235
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:04,829
No!

236
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,585
Give me the
tape recorder.

237
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:14,756
Tell us, Rose.

238
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:18,927
It's been 84 years--

239
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:21,221
It's okay. Just try
to remember anything...

240
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,639
...anything at all.

241
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:26,601
Do you want to hear this
or not, Mr. Lovett?

242
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:33,608
It's been 84 years...

243
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:38,446
...and I can still smell
the fresh paint.

244
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,076
The china had
never been used.

245
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:46,454
The sheets had
never been slept in.

246
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:52,043
Titanic was called
the ship of dreams.

247
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:54,712
And it was.

248
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:57,674
It really was.

249
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,414
All third-class
passengers...

250
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,749
...with a forward berth...

251
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:34,043
...this way please!
This queue!

252
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,087
It's a big boat, huh?

253
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,423
Daddy, it's a ship.

254
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:39,424
You're right.

255
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:11,414
I don't see what all
the fuss is about.

256
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,042
It doesn't look any bigger
than the Mauretania.

257
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:16,127
You can be blasÃ©
about some things, Rose...

258
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:17,879
...but not about Titanic.

259
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:19,922
It's over 100 feet longer
than Mauretania...

260
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,466
...and far more luxurious.

261
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,761
Your daughter is far too
difficult to impress, Ruth.

262
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,097
So this is the ship they
say is unsinkable.

263
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,223
It is unsinkable.

264
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:30,725
God Himself
could not sink this ship--

265
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:31,851
Wh at?!

266
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,436
You have to check your baggage
through the main terminal.

267
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:34,645
It's round that
way, sir.

268
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:36,564
I put my faith in
you good sir.

269
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:37,690
Now kindly
see my man.

270
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:39,108
Yes sir. It's my
pleasure, sir.

271
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:40,234
If I can do
anything at all...

272
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:41,569
Yes, right.

273
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:43,905
All the trunks from
that car there-

274
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:45,948
12 from here.

275
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,160
And the safe,
to the parlor suite...

276
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,912
...rooms B-52, 54, 56.

277
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:54,248
Ladies...

278
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:56,084
...we better hurry.

279
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:57,377
Come along.

280
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,132
- My coat?
- I have it, miss.

281
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:10,556
All third-class passengers
queue here for health inspection.

282
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:19,232
- Welcome aboard, ma'am.
- Welcome to Titanic.

283
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,610
<i>It was the ship of dreams...</i>

284
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,986
<i>...to everyone else.</i>

285
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:27,281
<i>To me, it was a
slave ship...</i>

286
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:30,785
<i>...taking me back to
America in chains.</i>

287
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:35,790
<i>Outwardly, I was everything</i>
a <i>Well brought up girl should be-</i>

288
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:38,626
<i>Inside, I was screaming.</i>

289
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:56,477
Jack, you are pazzo.

290
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,312
You bet everything
we have.

291
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:01,649
When you got nothing,
you got nothing to lose.

292
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,116
Sven?

293
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:34,182
All right,
moment of truth.

294
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:36,684
Someone's life is
about to change.

295
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:38,060
Fabrizio?

296
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,523
<i>Niente.</i>

297
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:44,692
Olaf?

298
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:46,861
Nothing.

299
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:48,362
Sven?

300
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:53,868
Uh-oh.
2 pair.

301
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:56,120
I'm sorry,
Fabrizio.

302
00:24:58,289 --> 00:24:59,499
I'm sorry...

303
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:00,666
...you're not gonna see
your mom again for a...

304
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,793
...long time...

305
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,462
...'cause we're
going to America.

306
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:05,838
Full house, boys!

307
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:21,229
Come on.

308
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:23,731
I'm going home!

309
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:28,277
I'm going home.

310
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:29,612
I go to America!

311
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:31,239
No, mate.

312
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:33,574
Titanic go to America,

313
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:35,076
in 5 minutes.

314
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:36,702
Shit. Fabri.
Come on.

315
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:37,745
Come on,
here. Here.

316
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:41,958
We're riding in
high style now!

317
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,669
We're a couple of
regular swells.

318
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:46,379
We're practically
goddamn royalty...

319
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:47,380
...ragazzo mio.

320
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:49,590
You see?
ls my destine.

321
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,217
Like I told you...

322
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:52,969
I go to America to
be millionaire.

323
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:57,515
You are pazzo.

324
00:25:57,515 --> 00:25:59,183
Maybe, but I've
got the tickets.

325
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:02,603
Come on, I thought
you were fast.

326
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:03,604
<i>Aspettal</i>

327
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:05,690
Whoa. Wait! Wait!

328
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:06,691
Hey, wait!

329
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,234
We're passengers!

330
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:12,488
Have you been through
the inspection queue?

331
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:13,573
Of course.

332
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:15,157
Anyway, we
don't have any lice.

333
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:17,118
We're Americans.
Both of us.

334
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:18,202
Right.

335
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,203
Come aboard.

336
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,167
We're the luckiest sons
of bitches in the world.

337
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,168
You know that?

338
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:36,387
Good-bye!

339
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:41,559
You know somebody?

340
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,060
Of course not.
That's not the point.

341
00:26:43,311 --> 00:26:44,645
Good-bye!
I'll miss you!

342
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:46,105
Good-bye!

343
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:48,274
I will never forget you!

344
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,491
Come with me,
darling. Let's go.

345
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:42,370
G-60.

346
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:45,039
G-60. G-60.

347
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:46,457
Excuse me,
ma'am.

348
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:48,709
G-60.

349
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,712
Oh, right here.

350
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:53,297
Hey, how you doing?

351
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:55,424
Jack. Nice
to meet you.

352
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,218
Jack Dawson.
Nice to meet you.

353
00:27:57,677 --> 00:27:58,678
How you doing?

354
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:01,722
Who says you get
top bunk, huh?

355
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:09,605
This is your private
promenade deck, sir.

356
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,857
Will you be requiring
anything?

357
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:13,401
Excuse me.

358
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:15,486
- This one?
- No.

359
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,988
It had a lot of faces on it.

360
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:19,907
This is the one.

361
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:23,411
Would you like all of
them out, miss?

362
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:26,914
Yes. We need a little
color in this room.

363
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:31,961
Put in there.
In the wardrobe.

364
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,172
God, not those finger
paintings again.

365
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:36,841
They certainly were a
waste of money.

366
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:39,009
The difference between
Cal's taste in art...

367
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,678
...and mine is that I have some.

368
00:28:40,678 --> 00:28:41,679
They're fascinating.

369
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:45,182
Like being inside a dream
or something.

370
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:46,767
There's truth but no logic.

371
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:49,854
- What's the artist's name?
- Something Picasso.

372
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:51,397
Something Picasso.

373
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:53,232
He won't amount
to a thing.

374
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:54,483
He won't, trust me.

375
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:57,027
- Let's put the Degas in the bedroom.
- At least they were cheap.

376
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,613
Put it in the wardrobe.

377
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:09,457
<i>At Cherbourg, a woman came aboard
named Margaret Brown.</i>

378
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,459
<i>We all called her Molly.</i>

379
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,962
<i>History would call her
the Unsinkable Molly Brown.</i>

380
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:17,548
Well, I wasn't about to
wait all day for you, sonny.

381
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:19,675
Here, if you think
you can manage.

382
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:23,304
<i>Her husband had struck gold
someplace out west.</i>

383
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:26,432
<i>And she was what Mother
called "new money."</i>

384
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:29,018
<i>By the next afternoon...</i>

385
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:31,729
...we were steaming west
from the <i>coast</i> of Ireland...

386
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:36,108
<i>...with nothing out ahead
of us but ocean.</i>

387
00:29:42,323 --> 00:29:44,492
Take herto sea,
Mr. Murdoch.

388
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:46,619
Let's stretch her legs.

389
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:48,078
Yes sir.

390
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:51,373
All ahead full, Mr. Moody.

391
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,167
Very good, sir.

392
00:29:58,631 --> 00:29:59,757
All ahead full.

393
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:01,884
All ahead full!

394
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:03,928
Come on lads,
step lively!

395
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:24,573
All right! Let's stoke
her right up!

396
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:25,991
We go full ahead!

397
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,327
Come on, put your
backs into it!

398
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,925
21 knots, sir.

399
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:34,852
Hey, look,
look, look!

400
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:39,440
See it?

401
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:44,778
There's another
one! See him?

402
00:31:55,164 --> 00:31:56,957
Look at that one!
Look at him jump!

403
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:25,819
I can see the Statue
of Liberty already.

404
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:27,571
Very small,
of course.

405
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:33,994
I'm the king
of the world!

406
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,043
<i>She is the largest moving object
ever made by the hand of man...</i>

407
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,295
...in all history.

408
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:27,840
And our master shipbuilder,
Mr. Andrews here...

409
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,717
...designed her from the
keel plates up.

410
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:32,094
I may have knocked
her together, but---

411
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:34,179
...the idea was
Mr. lsmay's.

412
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:37,099
He envisioned a steamer
so grand in scale...

413
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:38,225
...and so luxurious in...

414
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:39,351
...its appointments...

415
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:41,645
...that its supremacy
would never be challenged.

416
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:43,147
And here she is.

417
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:46,692
- Willed into solid reality.
- Hear, hear.

418
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,403
I'll have the salmon.

419
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:54,908
You know I don't
like that, Rose.

420
00:33:58,412 --> 00:33:59,747
She knows.

421
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,168
We'll both have
the lamb.

422
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:06,336
Rare, with very
little mint sauce.

423
00:34:07,421 --> 00:34:09,006
You like lamb,
right sweet pea?

424
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:13,844
You gonna cut her meat
for her too there, Cal?

425
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:19,266
Hey, who thought of
the name Titanic?

426
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,268
Was it you,
Bruce?

427
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:22,603
Yes, actually.

428
00:34:23,437 --> 00:34:27,608
I wanted to convey sheer size.
And size means stability...

429
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:31,111
...luxury, and above
all, strength.

430
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:34,448
Do you know of
Dr. Freud, Mr. lsmay?

431
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:39,036
His ideas about the male preoccupation
with size might be of particular interest to you.

432
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:41,789
What's gotten into you?

433
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,373
Excuse me.

434
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,296
I do apologize.

435
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:51,590
She's a pistol, Cal.
Hope you can handle her.

436
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:56,220
Well, I may have to start minding what she
reads from now on, won't I, Mrs. Brown?

437
00:34:56,637 --> 00:34:59,389
Freud? Who is he?
Is he a passenger?

438
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,529
The ship is nice, huh?

439
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:15,656
Yeah. It's an Irish ship.

440
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:16,782
Is English, no?

441
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:17,866
No, it was built
in Ireland.

442
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,868
15,000 lrishmen
built this ship.

443
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:22,538
Solid as a rock.
Big Irish hands.

444
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:24,331
That's typical.

445
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:27,376
First-class dogs
come down here to take a shite.

446
00:35:28,127 --> 00:35:30,170
Lets us know where we rank
in the scheme of things.

447
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:32,047
Like we could forget?

448
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:34,883
I'm Tommy Ryan.

449
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:37,219
- Jack Dawson.
- Fabrizio.

450
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:40,848
Do you make any money
with your drawings?

451
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,652
Ah, forget it, boyo.

452
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:56,071
You'd as like have angels fly out of
your arse as get next to...

453
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,573
...the likes of her.

454
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:24,933
<i>I saw my whole life
as if I'd already lived it.</i>

455
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:28,770
<i>An endless parade
of parties and cotillions...</i>

456
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:31,106
<i>yachts and polo matches.</i>

457
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:36,445
<i>Always the same narrow people,
the same mindless chatter.</i>

458
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:40,782
<i>I felt like I was standing
at a great precipice...</i>

459
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:45,621
<i>...with no one to pull me back.
No one who cared...</i>

460
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:48,123
<i>...or even noticed.</i>

461
00:38:38,692 --> 00:38:39,693
Don't do it.

462
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:42,070
Stay back.

463
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,072
Don't come any closer.

464
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:46,908
Come on.

465
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,327
Just give me your hand.
I'll pull you back over.

466
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:49,745
No!
Stay where you are.

467
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,080
I mean it.

468
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:54,416
I'll let go.

469
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:06,928
No, you won't.

470
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,265
What do you mean,
no I won't?

471
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:13,352
Don't presume to tell me
what I will and will not do.

472
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:14,603
You don't know me.

473
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:16,772
Well, you would have done it already.

474
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:19,608
You're distracting me.
Go away.

475
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,276
I can't.

476
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:22,527
I'm involved now.

477
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:26,782
You let go, and I'm going to have
to jump in there after you.

478
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:30,118
Don't be absurd.

479
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:32,621
- You'll be killed.
- I'm a good swimmer.

480
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:34,790
The fall alone will kill you.

481
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:38,293
It would hurt. I'm not
saying it wouldn't.

482
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,087
Tell you the truth...

483
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:43,215
...I'm a lot more concerned
about that water being so cold.

484
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:51,598
How cold?

485
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:55,143
Freezing.
Maybe a couple degrees over.

486
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:00,649
You ever, uh...

487
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,734
...ever been
to Wisconsin?

488
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:07,155
Wh at?

489
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,658
Well, they have some of
the coldest winters around.

490
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:12,828
I grew up there,
near Chippewa Falls.

491
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:16,832
I remember when I was a kid,
me and my father, we went ice fishing...

492
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,000
...out on Lake Wissota.

493
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:20,836
Ice fishing is, you know, where you--

494
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,754
I know what ice fishing is!

495
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,173
Sorry.

496
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:30,011
You just seem like, you know,
kind of an indoor girl.

497
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,348
Anyway, I...

498
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:36,351
...fell through some thin ice.

499
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:38,186
And I'm telling you...

500
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:41,314
...water that cold,

501
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,191
like right down there...

502
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:47,320
...it hits you like 1000 knives
stabbing you all over your body.

503
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:50,157
You can't breathe.

504
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:55,662
You can't think. Least not about
anything but the pain.

505
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:01,960
Which is why I'm not looking
forward to jumping in there after you.

506
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:04,045
Like I said...

507
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:07,549
...I don't have a choice.

508
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,639
I guess I'm kind of hoping you'll
come back over the rail and...

509
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,057
...and get me off
the hook here.

510
00:41:16,892 --> 00:41:18,226
You're crazy.

511
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:21,730
That's what everybody says but...

512
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:24,983
...with all due respect, miss...

513
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:27,736
...I'm not the one hanging off
the back of a ship here.

514
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:29,905
Come on.

515
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:32,240
Come on, give me your hand.

516
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:34,409
You don't want to do this.

517
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:51,927
I'm Jack Dawson.

518
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:55,096
Rose DeWitt Bu kater.

519
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:57,098
I'll have to get you to
write that one down.

520
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:00,769
Come on.

521
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:07,067
I got you.

522
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:08,568
Come on.

523
00:42:08,944 --> 00:42:10,278
Come on.

524
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:16,076
Help, please!

525
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:17,953
Help!

526
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:20,580
- Please, help me!
- Listen. Listen to me.

527
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,290
Listen. Listen to me.

528
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,959
I've got you.
I won't let go.

529
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:26,253
Now pull yourself up.
Come on!

530
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:30,298
Come on.

531
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:31,591
That's right.

532
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:33,218
You can do it.

533
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:39,474
I got you.

534
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:46,648
What's all this?

535
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:53,655
You stand back and...

536
00:42:53,989 --> 00:42:55,407
...don't move an inch!

537
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:58,868
Fetch the Master at Arms.

538
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:03,164
This is completely unacceptable!

539
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:06,001
What made you think that you could
put your hands on my fiancÃ©e?!

540
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:08,837
Look at me, you filth!

541
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,338
Cal.

542
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:11,464
What do you think
you were doing?

543
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:14,175
Cal, stop.
It was an accident.

544
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:16,511
An accident?

545
00:43:16,845 --> 00:43:18,179
It was.

546
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,348
Stupid, really.

547
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:23,685
I was leaning over and I slipped.

548
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:29,691
I was leaning far over
to see the, uh...

549
00:43:30,025 --> 00:43:32,360
...uh, uh, the uh...

550
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:35,530
- Propellers?
- Propellers, and I slipped.

551
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:38,533
And I would have gone
overboard but Mr. Dawson here...

552
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:42,037
...saved me. And almost
went over himself.

553
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,039
You wanted to see the...
She wanted to see the propellers.

554
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:47,542
Like I said, women and
machinery do not mix.

555
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:50,378
Was that the way of it?

556
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:54,883
Yeah. Yeah, that
was pretty much it.

557
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:56,718
Well, the boy's a hero then.

558
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:58,637
Good for you, son.
Well done.

559
00:43:58,887 --> 00:44:00,889
So, it's all's well and back
to our brandy, eh?

560
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:06,895
Look at you. You must be freezing.
Let's get you inside.

561
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,898
Perhaps a little something
for the boy?

562
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:13,401
Of course.

563
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:17,238
Mr. Lovejoy,
I think a 20 should do it.

564
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:20,575
Is that the going rate
for saving the woman you love?

565
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:24,079
Rose is displeased.

566
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:26,247
What to do?

567
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:27,707
I know.

568
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:33,588
Perhaps you could join us for
dinner tomorrow evening...

569
00:44:33,922 --> 00:44:35,423
...to regale our group...

570
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:37,926
...with your heroic tale.

571
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,430
Sure.
Count me in.

572
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:45,100
Good.
It's settled then.

573
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:47,435
This should be interesting.

574
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:59,447
Can I bum a smoke?

575
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:09,457
You'll want to tie those.

576
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:13,211
It's interesting...

577
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:15,547
...the young lady slipped
so suddenly...

578
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:19,134
...and you still had time to remove
your jacket and your shoes.

579
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,318
I know you've been melancholy.

580
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,321
I don't pretend to know why.

581
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:45,160
I intended to save this...

582
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:50,331
...until the engagement
gala next week...

583
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:54,002
...but, I thought...

584
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:55,670
...tonight.

585
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:58,339
Good gracious.

586
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:02,010
Perhaps as a reminder
of my feelings for you.

587
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:04,137
- Is it a--
- Diamond. Yes.

588
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:09,851
56 carats to be exact.

589
00:46:11,853 --> 00:46:14,189
It was worn by Louis XVI.

590
00:46:15,023 --> 00:46:17,358
And they called
it Le Coeur de Ia Mer.

591
00:46:17,859 --> 00:46:19,694
- The Heart of the Ocean.
- The Heart of the Ocean. Yes.

592
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:27,869
It's overwhelming.

593
00:46:28,328 --> 00:46:29,996
Well, it's for royalty.

594
00:46:31,206 --> 00:46:33,374
We are royalty, Rose.

595
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:39,714
You know, there's
nothing I couldn't give you.

596
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:42,550
There's nothing I'd deny you...

597
00:46:43,218 --> 00:46:45,386
...if you would not deny me.

598
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:51,893
Open your heart to me, Rose.

599
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:11,287
Well, I've been on my own since
I was 15, since my folks died.

600
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:16,417
And I had no brothers or sisters or
close kin in that part of the country...

601
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:20,213
...so I lit on out of there and I
haven't been back since.

602
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:22,590
You could just call me a
tumbleweed blowing in the wind.

603
00:47:25,093 --> 00:47:29,264
Well, Rose, we've walked about a mile
around this boat deck and...

604
00:47:29,556 --> 00:47:32,559
...chewed over how great the weather's
been and how I grew up...

605
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:36,437
...but I reckon that's not why
you came to talk to me, is it?

606
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:40,441
- Mr. Dawson, I--
- Jack.

607
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,861
Jack.

608
00:47:43,278 --> 00:47:46,614
I want to thank you
for what you did.

609
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:51,286
Not just for pulling me back,
but for your discretion.

610
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:52,954
You're welcome.

611
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:54,455
Look.

612
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,209
I know what you
must be thinking.

613
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:00,253
Poor little rich girl.

614
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:02,380
What does she know about misery?

615
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:03,631
No.

616
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:06,801
No, that's not what I was thinking.

617
00:48:07,135 --> 00:48:08,553
What I was thinking was...

618
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:11,973
---what could have happened to this girl
to make her think she had no way out?

619
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:15,643
Well I...

620
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:20,440
It was everything.
It was my whole world and...

621
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:21,733
...all the people in it.

622
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,570
And the inertia of my life,
plunging ahead and me...

623
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:27,614
...powerless to stop it.

624
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,824
God,
look at that thing.

625
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:32,285
You would have gone
straight to the bottom.

626
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:36,497
500 invitations have gone out.

627
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:39,500
All of Philadelphia society will be there.

628
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:41,794
And all the while I feel I'm...

629
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:44,172
...standing in the middle
of a crowded room...

630
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:45,965
...screaming at the
top of my lungs...

631
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:47,175
...and no one
even looks up.

632
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:50,011
Do you love him?

633
00:48:51,346 --> 00:48:52,347
Pardon me?

634
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,140
Do you love him?

635
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:57,685
You're being very rude. You
shouldn't be asking me this.

636
00:48:58,144 --> 00:49:00,688
Well, it's a simple question.
Do you love the guy or not?

637
00:49:03,149 --> 00:49:05,193
This is not a suitable conversation.

638
00:49:05,485 --> 00:49:06,694
VVhy can't you just
answer the question?

639
00:49:09,364 --> 00:49:11,324
This is absurd.

640
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:13,034
You don't know me
and I don't know you...

641
00:49:13,326 --> 00:49:16,329
...and we are not having this
conversation at all. You are rude...

642
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:19,874
...and uncouth and presumptuous
and I am leaving now...

643
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:23,211
...Jack. Mr. Dawson.
It's been a pleasure.

644
00:49:23,211 --> 00:49:24,963
I sought you out to thank you
and now I have thanked you.

645
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:27,173
And you've insulted me.

646
00:49:27,382 --> 00:49:29,008
Well, you deserved it.

647
00:49:29,217 --> 00:49:30,385
- Right.
- Right.

648
00:49:33,388 --> 00:49:35,014
I thought you were leaving.

649
00:49:35,223 --> 00:49:36,557
I am.

650
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:40,061
You are so annoying.

651
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:42,563
Wait.

652
00:49:42,814 --> 00:49:47,068
I don't have to leave. This is
my part of the ship. You leave.

653
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:50,405
Well, well, well.
Now who's being rude?

654
00:49:54,242 --> 00:49:57,078
What is this stupid thing
you're carrying around?

655
00:49:58,246 --> 00:50:00,581
So, what are you,
an artist or something?

656
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:06,587
These are rather good.

657
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:13,094
They're very good, actually.

658
00:50:20,435 --> 00:50:22,103
Jack, this is exquisite work.

659
00:50:22,437 --> 00:50:25,273
Ah, they didn't think too
much of them in old Paree.

660
00:50:25,273 --> 00:50:26,607
Paris?

661
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,570
You do get around
for a p--

662
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:36,075
Well, a-- a
person of limited means.

663
00:50:36,284 --> 00:50:38,286
Go on. A poor guy. You can say it.

664
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:43,291
Well, well, well.

665
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:49,255
And these were drawn from life?

666
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,802
Well, that's one of the good things about Paris.

667
00:50:55,303 --> 00:50:56,721
Lots of girls are willing
to take their clothes off.

668
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:04,645
You liked this woman.

669
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,648
You used her several times.

670
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:09,817
Well.

671
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:12,487
She had beautiful
hands, you see?

672
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:17,325
I think you must have
had a love affair with her.

673
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:19,827
No, no, no.
Just with her hands.

674
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:22,830
She was a
one-legged prostitute.

675
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:24,957
See?

676
00:51:31,506 --> 00:51:33,508
She had a good
sense of humor though.

677
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,011
Oh, and this lady...

678
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:42,016
She used to sit at this bar every night...

679
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:43,684
...wearing every piece
of jewelry she owned...

680
00:51:43,935 --> 00:51:46,270
...just waiting for
her long, lost love.

681
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:49,357
We called her Madame Bijoux.

682
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:51,692
See, her clothes are all moth-eaten.

683
00:51:53,361 --> 00:51:56,197
Well,
you have a gift, Jack.

684
00:51:56,531 --> 00:51:57,865
You do.

685
00:51:58,199 --> 00:51:59,700
You see people.

686
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:01,536
I see you.

687
00:52:03,955 --> 00:52:05,289
And?

688
00:52:06,666 --> 00:52:08,376
You wouldn't have jumped.

689
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:16,342
But the purpose of university
is to find a suitable husband.

690
00:52:16,551 --> 00:52:18,219
Rose has already done that.

691
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:21,389
Look, here comes that
vulgar Brown woman.

692
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:24,392
Quickly, get up before
she sits with us.

693
00:52:25,393 --> 00:52:28,020
Hello, girls. I was hoping
I'd catch you at tea.

694
00:52:28,229 --> 00:52:29,897
We're awfully sorry,
you missed it.

695
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:33,317
The Countess and I were just
off to take the air on the boat deck.

696
00:52:33,526 --> 00:52:36,571
What a lovely idea.
I need to catch up on my gossip.

697
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:41,242
Countess.

698
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:45,580
So, you've not yet lit the
last four boilers?

699
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,540
No, I don't see
the need.

700
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:49,417
We are making excellent time.

701
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:55,256
The press knows the size of Titanic.
Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.

702
00:52:55,548 --> 00:52:57,758
We must give them
something new to print.

703
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,762
This maiden voyage
of Titanic must...

704
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:03,848
...make headlines.

705
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:08,102
Mr. lsmay, I would prefer
not to push the engines...

706
00:53:08,436 --> 00:53:10,938
...until they've been properly run in.

707
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:13,608
Of course I'm just a passenger.

708
00:53:13,608 --> 00:53:16,027
I leave it to your good offices
to decide what's best.

709
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:19,447
But what a glorious end to your final crossing...

710
00:53:19,447 --> 00:53:21,032
...if we were to get into New York
on Tuesday night...

711
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,784
...and surprise them all.
Make the morning papers.

712
00:53:24,577 --> 00:53:26,579
Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?

713
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:31,626
Good man.

714
00:53:33,044 --> 00:53:35,546
After that, I worked
on a squid boat in Monterey...

715
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:38,466
...then I went to Los Angeles to the...

716
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:41,886
...Santa Monica pier
and did portraits for 10 cents each.

717
00:53:42,637 --> 00:53:44,472
Why can't I be like you?

718
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:48,309
Just head out for the horizon
whenever I feel like it.

719
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:53,064
Say we'll go there sometime, to that pier...

720
00:53:53,314 --> 00:53:55,483
only if we just talk about it

721
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:58,653
No, we'll do it. We'll drink cheap beer.

722
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:01,656
Ride on the roller coaster till we throw up

723
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:05,159
We'll ride horses on the beach, in the surf.

724
00:54:05,493 --> 00:54:09,497
But you have to do it like a real cowboy.
No sidesaddle stuff.

725
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:12,667
You mean with one leg on each side?

726
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:15,002
Can you show me?

727
00:54:15,253 --> 00:54:17,088
Sure, if you like.

728
00:54:18,673 --> 00:54:20,341
Teach me to ride like a man.

729
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:21,926
Chew tobacco like a man.

730
00:54:23,511 --> 00:54:25,680
And spit like a man.

731
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:27,765
You didn't learn in finishing school?

732
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:29,183
No.

733
00:54:29,517 --> 00:54:31,352
Come on, I'll show you.

734
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:33,354
I'll show you how.

735
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:36,524
Jack! No, Jack, no. Wait.

736
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:39,860
I couldn't possibly, Jack.

737
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:41,862
Watch closely.

738
00:54:43,531 --> 00:54:45,533
That's disgusting.

739
00:54:45,533 --> 00:54:46,534
Your turn

740
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:51,872
That was pitiful.
You really have to hawk it back.

741
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:55,209
Get some leverage.
Use your arms. Arc your neck.

742
00:54:56,544 --> 00:54:58,546
You see the range on that thing?

743
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,548
Okay, go.

744
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:09,056
That was better. You have to work on it.
Really try to hawk it up.

745
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:18,316
Mother.

746
00:55:23,738 --> 00:55:26,073
May I introduce Jack Dawson?

747
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:29,076
Charmed, I'm sure.

748
00:55:33,748 --> 00:55:38,419
<i>The others were gracious and curious
about the man who'd saved my life.</i>

749
00:55:39,587 --> 00:55:42,590
<i>But my mother looked at him like an insect.</i>

750
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:47,094
<i>A dangerous insect
which must be squashed quickly.</i>

751
00:55:47,428 --> 00:55:51,265
Sounds like you're a good man
to have around in a sticky spot.

752
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:58,939
Why do they always insist on announcing
dinner like a damn cavalry charge?

753
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:00,941
Shall we go dress, Mother?

754
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:03,778
See you at dinner, Jack.

755
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:06,781
Uh, son?

756
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:08,449
Son!

757
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:11,285
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

758
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:13,287
Not really.

759
00:56:13,621 --> 00:56:16,123
You're about to go into the snake pit.

760
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:20,211
What are you going to wear?

761
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:25,299
I figured. Come on.

762
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:32,306
I was right. You and my son
are just about the same size.

763
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,308
Pretty close.

764
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:40,314
You shine up like a new penny.

765
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:53,828
Good evening, sir.

766
00:57:58,142 --> 00:58:00,895
Thousands of tons of Hockley steel
are in this ship.

767
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:03,230
- Which part?
- All the right ones.

768
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:06,650
Then you're accountable
if there's a problem. Where's Rose?

769
00:58:06,901 --> 00:58:08,235
She'll be along.

770
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:10,571
There is the Countess.

771
00:58:39,433 --> 00:58:42,937
I saw that in a nickelodeon
and always wanted to do it.

772
00:58:57,368 --> 00:58:58,536
Darling...

773
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,288
...surely you remember Mr. Dawson.

774
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:07,711
It's amazing.
You could almost pass for a gentleman.

775
00:59:08,963 --> 00:59:10,130
Almost.

776
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:11,882
This is extraordinary.

777
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,148
This is a remarkable voyage.

778
00:59:28,399 --> 00:59:29,817
- Mad.
- Completely lunatic.

779
00:59:31,569 --> 00:59:33,571
There's the Countess of Rothes.

780
00:59:35,656 --> 00:59:38,659
That's John Jacob Astor...

781
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:40,995
...the richest man on board.

782
00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:45,165
His little wifey, Madeleine,
is my age and in a delicate condition.

783
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,002
See how she tries to hide it.

784
00:59:48,252 --> 00:59:49,670
Quite the scandal.

785
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:54,675
Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress,
Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim...

786
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:58,596
...is at home with the children, of course.
And over here...

787
00:59:58,846 --> 01:00:00,514
...Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon.

788
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:04,101
She designs naughty lingerie,
among her many talents.

789
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:06,687
Very popular with the royals.

790
01:00:07,688 --> 01:00:09,523
Congratulations. She's splendid.

791
01:00:09,857 --> 01:00:11,358
Why, thank you.

792
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:13,611
Escort a lady to dinner?

793
01:00:13,861 --> 01:00:15,362
Certainly.

794
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:18,699
Sweet pea, sweet pea.

795
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:20,951
Ain't nothing to it.

796
01:00:21,702 --> 01:00:26,206
They love money. Pretend like you own
a gold mine and you're in the club.

797
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,044
Hey, Astor.

798
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:33,547
Hello, Molly. Nice to see you.

799
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:36,717
J.J., Madeleine,
I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.

800
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:39,470
Well, Jack...

801
01:00:39,887 --> 01:00:41,555
...are you of the Boston Dawsons?

802
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:45,142
No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.

803
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:46,727
Oh, yes.

804
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:52,733
<i>He must have been nervous,
but he never faltered.</i>

805
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:55,736
<i>They assumed he was one of them.</i>

806
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:59,239
<i>Heir to a rail road fortune, perhaps.</i>

807
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:03,744
<i>New money, obviously,
but still a member of the club.</i>

808
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:07,831
<i>Mother, of course,
could always be counted upon.</i>

809
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:13,337
Tell us of the accommodations in steerage
Mr- Dawson- I hear they're quite good-

810
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:18,008
The best I've seen, ma'am. Hardly any rats.

811
01:01:21,095 --> 01:01:23,931
Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class.

812
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:26,517
He was of help to my fiancÃ©e last night.

813
01:01:26,767 --> 01:01:29,603
It happens Mr. Dawson is quite a fine artist.

814
01:01:29,937 --> 01:01:32,439
He showed me some of his work today.

815
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:37,778
Rose and I differ in our definition of fine art.
Not to impugn your work, sir.

816
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:49,623
Are all these mine?

817
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:51,959
Start from the outside and work in.

818
01:01:52,209 --> 01:01:54,211
He knows every rivet in her.

819
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:56,797
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews.

820
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:58,382
Thank you, Rose.

821
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:03,137
How do you take your caviar, sir?

822
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:06,640
No caviar for me, thanks.
Never did like it much.

823
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:11,145
Where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson?

824
01:02:11,562 --> 01:02:14,565
Right now, my address is the RMS Titanic.

825
01:02:14,815 --> 01:02:16,817
After that, I'm on God's good humor.

826
01:02:17,317 --> 01:02:19,236
How do you have means to travel?

827
01:02:20,154 --> 01:02:24,324
I work my way from place to place.
Tramp steamers and such.

828
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:28,328
I won my ticket on Titanic
at a lucky hand at poker.

829
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:30,080
A very lucky hand.

830
01:02:30,998 --> 01:02:33,000
All life is a game of luck.

831
01:02:34,168 --> 01:02:37,087
A real man makes his own luck.
Right, Dawson?

832
01:02:38,756 --> 01:02:42,593
And you find
that sort of rootless existence appealing?

833
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:47,264
Yes, ma'am, I do.

834
01:02:48,015 --> 01:02:51,018
I've got everything I need
right here with me.

835
01:02:51,268 --> 01:02:54,104
I have air in my lungs
and blank sheets of paper.

836
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:59,943
I love waking up, not knowing
what will happen or who I'll meet.

837
01:03:00,861 --> 01:03:02,279
Where I'll wind up.

838
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:04,948
One night I'm sleeping under a bridge...

839
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:09,453
...now I'm on the grandest ship
in the world, with you fine people.

840
01:03:09,703 --> 01:03:10,704
I'll take more of that.

841
01:03:12,039 --> 01:03:15,042
Life's a gift. I don't intend on wasting it.

842
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:18,879
You never know what hand you'll get dealt.

843
01:03:19,213 --> 01:03:21,882
You take life as it comes at you. Here, Cal.

844
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:26,136
Make each day count.

845
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:27,971
Well said, Jack.

846
01:03:28,222 --> 01:03:29,306
Hear, hear.

847
01:03:30,307 --> 01:03:31,892
To making it count.

848
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,229
To making it count.

849
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:36,730
Bravo.

850
01:03:43,654 --> 01:03:47,407
But Mr. Brown didn't know
I'd hidden the money in the stove.

851
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:52,746
He comes home drunk as a pig celebrating
and lights a fire.

852
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:58,418
Next is brandy in the smoking room.

853
01:04:00,587 --> 01:04:02,673
Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?

854
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:09,012
Now they retreat to congratulate each
other on being masters of the universe.

855
01:04:09,263 --> 01:04:11,265
Ladies, thank you for your company.

856
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:14,017
May I escort you to the cabin?

857
01:04:14,268 --> 01:04:15,269
No, I'll stay here.

858
01:04:16,103 --> 01:04:17,104
Here, Molly.

859
01:04:18,105 --> 01:04:20,107
Joining us, Dawson?

860
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,776
You don't want to stay with the women.

861
01:04:23,277 --> 01:04:25,612
No, thanks. I have to head back.

862
01:04:25,946 --> 01:04:30,617
That's best. It'll be all business and politics.
Wouldn't interest you.

863
01:04:31,702 --> 01:04:34,371
But Dawson, good of you to come.

864
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,295
Must you go?

865
01:04:41,545 --> 01:04:43,881
Time for me to row with the other slaves.

866
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:48,802
Good night, Rose.

867
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:31,345
Want to go to a real party?

868
01:05:41,772 --> 01:05:43,941
Is okay I put my hand here?

869
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:05,545
I can't understand you.

870
01:06:37,828 --> 01:06:40,330
I'm going to dance with her now.

871
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:41,331
Come on.

872
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:43,917
Come on. Come with me.

873
01:06:44,251 --> 01:06:46,086
Jack. Jack, wait.

874
01:06:48,422 --> 01:06:49,423
I can't do this.

875
01:06:49,673 --> 01:06:51,508
We'll have to get a bit closer.

876
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:52,926
Like this.

877
01:06:56,263 --> 01:06:57,931
You're still my best girl, Cora.

878
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:04,354
- I don't know the steps.
- Me, either. Just go with it.

879
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:06,189
Don't think.

880
01:07:25,292 --> 01:07:27,961
Wait! Jack! Wait! Stop, Jack!

881
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:39,306
Wh at? Wait!

882
01:08:20,514 --> 01:08:22,182
Jack, no.

883
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:31,691
--Beyond the jurisdiction
of the Sherman Act.

884
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:35,779
That's what Rockefeller said--
Supreme Court didn't swallow it.

885
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:59,719
What? You think
a first-class girl can't drink?

886
01:09:01,972 --> 01:09:02,973
Get out of here.

887
01:09:03,557 --> 01:09:04,891
Are you all right?

888
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:07,894
I'm fine.

889
01:09:08,145 --> 01:09:10,147
Two out of three.

890
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:12,399
So...

891
01:09:13,567 --> 01:09:15,569
...you think you're tough?

892
01:09:16,903 --> 01:09:18,405
Let's see you do this.

893
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:23,410
Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.

894
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:42,179
Jesus!

895
01:09:42,429 --> 01:09:43,597
You okay?

896
01:09:43,847 --> 01:09:45,432
I haven't done that in years.

897
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:56,276
Come on, lads. Give it all you got. Let's go.

898
01:10:22,302 --> 01:10:23,637
Coffee, sir?

899
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:35,232
You didn't come to me last night.

900
01:10:37,484 --> 01:10:38,985
I was tired.

901
01:10:41,488 --> 01:10:44,157
Your exertions below deck
were no doubt exhausting.

902
01:10:47,327 --> 01:10:50,830
I see you had
that undertaker of a manservant follow me.

903
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:54,084
You will never behave like that again.

904
01:10:57,671 --> 01:11:00,674
I'm not one of your mill foremen
who you can command.

905
01:11:02,175 --> 01:11:03,843
I'm your fiancÃ©e.

906
01:11:05,512 --> 01:11:07,514
My fiancÃ©e. My fiancÃ©e!

907
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:09,849
Yes, you are! And my wife!

908
01:11:11,184 --> 01:11:15,689
My wife in practice,
if not yet by law, so you will honor me!

909
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:18,775
You will honor me the way
a wife honors her husband.

910
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:21,278
Because I will not be made a fool of.

911
01:11:22,112 --> 01:11:23,947
Is this in any way unclear?

912
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:26,032
No.

913
01:11:26,366 --> 01:11:28,702
Good. Excuse me.

914
01:11:34,374 --> 01:11:36,042
Oh, Miss Rose.

915
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:39,296
We had a little accident.

916
01:11:39,546 --> 01:11:41,715
- That's all right.
- I'm sorry.

917
01:11:42,132 --> 01:11:43,133
Let me help you.

918
01:11:43,383 --> 01:11:45,051
It's all right, miss.

919
01:11:51,558 --> 01:11:52,976
It's all right, miss.

920
01:11:58,565 --> 01:11:59,899
Tea, Trudy.

921
01:12:17,417 --> 01:12:20,587
You're not to see that boy again.
You understand?

922
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:24,257
Rose, I forbid it.

923
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:28,261
Stop it, Mother.
You'll give yourself a nosebleed.

924
01:12:28,595 --> 01:12:30,263
This is not a game.

925
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:34,434
Our situation is precarious.
You know the money's gone.

926
01:12:34,768 --> 01:12:39,105
Of course I know.
You remind me every day.

927
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:45,028
Your father left us nothing but a legacy
of bad debts hidden by a good name.

928
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:47,947
That name is the only card we have to play.

929
01:12:48,615 --> 01:12:50,283
I don't understand you.

930
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:54,954
It is a fine match with Hockley.
It will ensure our survival.

931
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:57,957
How can you put this on me?

932
01:12:58,208 --> 01:12:59,709
Why are you being so selfish?

933
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:02,045
I'm being selfish?

934
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:08,468
Do you want to see me
working as a seamstress?

935
01:13:10,303 --> 01:13:12,138
Is that what you want?

936
01:13:14,808 --> 01:13:17,644
To see our fine things sold at auction?

937
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:21,147
Our memories scattered?

938
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:33,993
It's so unfair.

939
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:37,163
Of course it's unfair.

940
01:13:38,498 --> 01:13:39,833
We're women.

941
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:44,504
Our choices are never easy.

942
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:10,196
<i>Protect them by Thy guiding hand</i>

943
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:15,368
<i>From every peril on the land</i>

944
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:21,374
<i>O, spirit whom the Father sent</i>

945
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:26,212
<i>To spread abroad the firmament</i>

946
01:14:26,546 --> 01:14:30,884
<i>O, wind of heaven, by Thy might</i>

947
01:14:31,217 --> 01:14:36,055
<i>Save all who dare the eagle 's ï¬ight</i>

948
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:40,226
<i>And keep them by Thy watchful care...</i>

949
01:14:42,896 --> 01:14:44,564
Hello, Mr. Andrews.

950
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:56,242
I need to talk to someone.

951
01:14:56,493 --> 01:14:58,745
You're not supposed to be in here.

952
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:05,001
I was here last night, remember?

953
01:15:05,251 --> 01:15:06,920
No. Now please turn around.

954
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:10,006
He'll tell you. I just need to talk--

955
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:13,426
Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater...

956
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:16,596
...are still appreciative of your assistance.

957
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:20,433
They asked me
to give you this in gratitude--

958
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:22,268
I don't want your money.

959
01:15:22,602 --> 01:15:26,439
--And remind you you are
in third class and your presence here...

960
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:28,441
...is no longer appropriate.

961
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:30,026
Let me speak to Rose.

962
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:34,280
Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawson
returns to where he belongs...

963
01:15:34,614 --> 01:15:36,282
...and that he stays there?

964
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:38,117
Yes, sir.

965
01:15:38,368 --> 01:15:39,536
Come along, you.

966
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:44,791
<i>Hear us when we cry to Thee</i>

967
01:15:45,124 --> 01:15:49,629
<i>For those in peril on the sea</i>

968
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:52,465
Why are there two steering wheels?

969
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:54,217
We use this one near shore.

970
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:58,137
Excuse me, sir.
Another ice warning, from the Noordam.

971
01:15:58,388 --> 01:15:59,722
Thank you, Sparks.

972
01:16:01,975 --> 01:16:05,311
Not to worry.
Quite normal for this time of year.

973
01:16:06,312 --> 01:16:10,316
In fact, we're speeding up.
I've ordered the last boilers lit.

974
01:16:14,362 --> 01:16:17,323
Okay, son, wind it up tight
like I showed you. That's right.

975
01:16:17,532 --> 01:16:19,158
Okay, now let it go.

976
01:16:22,203 --> 01:16:24,205
- It was good, wasn't it?
- Quite nice. That's excellent.

977
01:16:31,212 --> 01:16:34,215
Mr. Andrews...Forgive me.

978
01:16:34,841 --> 01:16:36,259
I did the sum
in my head...

979
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:40,388
...and with the number of lifeboats
times the capacity you mentioned...

980
01:16:40,722 --> 01:16:44,225
Forgive me, but it seems that there are
not enough for everyone aboard.

981
01:16:45,018 --> 01:16:46,728
About half, actually.

982
01:16:47,562 --> 01:16:49,063
Rose, you miss nothing,
do you?

983
01:16:49,897 --> 01:16:52,066
In fact, I put in these new
type davits...

984
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:55,028
...which can take an extra row
of boats inside this one.

985
01:16:55,737 --> 01:16:57,864
But it was thought,
by some...

986
01:16:57,864 --> 01:16:59,449
...the deck would look
too cluttered.

987
01:16:59,907 --> 01:17:02,243
So, I was overruled.

988
01:17:02,744 --> 01:17:05,747
It's a waste of deck space
as it is on an unsinkable ship.

989
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,874
Sleep soundly, young Rose.

990
01:17:07,874 --> 01:17:10,460
I have built you a good ship,
strong and true.

991
01:17:10,752 --> 01:17:12,420
She's all the lifeboat
you need.

992
01:17:12,754 --> 01:17:15,757
Just keep heading aft. The next
stop will be the engine room.

993
01:17:21,095 --> 01:17:25,433
Jack, this is impossible.
I can't see you.

994
01:17:25,725 --> 01:17:28,603
- I need to talk to you.
- No, Jack. No.

995
01:17:30,104 --> 01:17:32,440
Jack.
I'm engaged.

996
01:17:33,441 --> 01:17:35,276
I'm marrying Cal.

997
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:37,236
I love Cal.

998
01:17:39,781 --> 01:17:41,115
Rose...

999
01:17:41,616 --> 01:17:46,120
...you're no picnic. All right?
You're a spoiled little brat even.

1000
01:17:46,454 --> 01:17:50,958
But under that, you're the
most amazingly, astounding

1001
01:17:51,292 --> 01:17:52,960
...wonderful girl...

1002
01:17:53,586 --> 01:17:55,505
...woman, that I've ever known.

1003
01:17:55,505 --> 01:17:56,631
Jack, I--

1004
01:17:56,631 --> 01:17:59,342
No, let me try and get
this out. You're ama--

1005
01:18:01,803 --> 01:18:04,806
I'm not an idiot.
I know how the world works.

1006
01:18:05,139 --> 01:18:07,141
I've got ten bucks
in my pocket.

1007
01:18:07,141 --> 01:18:09,936
I have nothing to offer
you and I know that.

1008
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:11,813
I understand.

1009
01:18:12,772 --> 01:18:14,440
But I'm too involved now.

1010
01:18:14,816 --> 01:18:16,818
You jump, I jump
Remember?

1011
01:18:17,151 --> 01:18:19,654
I can't turn away without
knowing you'll be all right.

1012
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:22,448
That's all that I want.

1013
01:18:23,825 --> 01:18:25,326
Well, I'm fine.

1014
01:18:26,494 --> 01:18:28,996
I'll be fine. Really.

1015
01:18:29,997 --> 01:18:31,165
Really?

1016
01:18:33,334 --> 01:18:34,836
I don't think so.

1017
01:18:35,837 --> 01:18:38,131
They've got you trapped, Rose.

1018
01:18:38,131 --> 01:18:39,632
And you're gonna die if you
don't break free.

1019
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:40,800
Maybe not right away...

1020
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,468
...because you're strong...

1021
01:18:43,845 --> 01:18:47,181
...but sooner or later that
fire that I love about you, Rose...

1022
01:18:47,515 --> 01:18:50,017
...that fire is gonna
burn out.

1023
01:18:54,856 --> 01:18:56,649
It's not up to you
to save me, Jack.

1024
01:18:59,152 --> 01:19:00,361
You're right.

1025
01:19:01,696 --> 01:19:03,364
Only you can do that.

1026
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:10,872
I'm going back.

1027
01:19:11,205 --> 01:19:12,707
Leave me alone.

1028
01:19:24,218 --> 01:19:27,388
Tell Lucile about the disaster
you had with the stationers.

1029
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:30,349
Well, of course the invitations
had to be sent back, twice.

1030
01:19:30,558 --> 01:19:31,726
Oh, my dear.

1031
01:19:32,018 --> 01:19:33,686
And the dreadful
bridesmaids' gowns.

1032
01:19:33,686 --> 01:19:36,022
Let me tell you what an
odyssey that has been.

1033
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:38,524
Rose decided she
wanted lavender.

1034
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:40,443
She knows I detest the color.

1035
01:19:40,902 --> 01:19:42,195
So, she did it only to spite me.

1036
01:19:42,403 --> 01:19:44,405
If only you'd come to
me sooner.

1037
01:19:44,697 --> 01:19:47,533
<i>Ruth saw some of my designs in
La Mode IllustrÃ©e.</i>

1038
01:19:47,742 --> 01:19:51,204
They were for the trousseau of the Duchess
of Marlborough's youngest daughter.

1039
01:19:51,204 --> 01:19:52,288
They were quite charming.

1040
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:54,290
But, I think you'll agree,
my dear, that together...

1041
01:19:54,582 --> 01:19:57,752
...we've created something
of a phoenix from the ashes.

1042
01:20:12,558 --> 01:20:13,559
Hello, Jack.

1043
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:21,108
I changed my mind.

1044
01:20:27,073 --> 01:20:28,282
They said you might be up here.

1045
01:20:31,285 --> 01:20:32,620
Give me your hand.

1046
01:20:40,127 --> 01:20:41,462
Now close your eyes.

1047
01:20:42,797 --> 01:20:44,131
Go on.

1048
01:20:47,468 --> 01:20:48,970
Now, step up.

1049
01:20:52,807 --> 01:20:54,183
Now, hold onto the railing.

1050
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:56,185
Keep your eyes closed.
Don't peek.

1051
01:20:56,435 --> 01:20:57,436
I'm not.

1052
01:20:58,813 --> 01:21:00,815
Now, step up onto the rail.

1053
01:21:04,819 --> 01:21:06,821
Hold on. Hold on.

1054
01:21:07,321 --> 01:21:09,156
Keep your eyes closed.

1055
01:21:09,657 --> 01:21:10,992
Do you trust me?

1056
01:21:11,492 --> 01:21:12,827
I trust you.

1057
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:23,671
All right...

1058
01:21:24,046 --> 01:21:25,548
---Open your eyes.

1059
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:33,639
I'm flying.

1060
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:35,141
Jack.

1061
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:04,378
<i>Come, Josephine, in my
ï¬ying machine. Going up...</i>

1062
01:22:05,212 --> 01:22:08,549
<i>...she goes. Up she goes.</i>

1063
01:22:56,263 --> 01:22:59,266
That was the last time
Titanic ever saw daylight.

1064
01:23:00,726 --> 01:23:02,812
We're up to dusk the
night of the sinking.

1065
01:23:03,646 --> 01:23:04,897
6 hours to go.

1066
01:23:05,106 --> 01:23:08,150
Incredible. There's Smith and
he's standing there and...

1067
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:09,819
...he's got the iceberg warning
in his fucking hand...

1068
01:23:10,069 --> 01:23:13,072
...excuse me--his hand,
and he's ordering more speed.

1069
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:16,450
26 years of experience
working against him.

1070
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:18,911
He figures anything big
enough to sink, the ship...

1071
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:20,663
...they're gonna see in time to turn.

1072
01:23:20,955 --> 01:23:23,582
But the ship's too big
with too small a rudder.

1073
01:23:23,582 --> 01:23:25,626
Doesn't corner worth a damn.

1074
01:23:26,794 --> 01:23:29,130
Everything he knows
is wrong.

1075
01:23:41,809 --> 01:23:45,646
It's quite proper, I assure you.
This is the sitting room.

1076
01:23:47,648 --> 01:23:49,150
- Will this light do?
- What?

1077
01:23:50,484 --> 01:23:51,819
Don't artists need good light?

1078
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:54,321
That is true, but I'm not
used to working in...

1079
01:23:55,114 --> 01:23:56,699
...such horrible conditions.

1080
01:23:57,491 --> 01:23:58,826
Monet!

1081
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:02,329
- Do you know his work?
- Of course.

1082
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:04,665
Look at his use of color here.
Isn't he great?

1083
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:06,959
I know. It's extraordinary.

1084
01:24:09,462 --> 01:24:12,798
Cal insists on carting
this hideous thing everywhere.

1085
01:24:13,466 --> 01:24:16,135
Should we be expecting him
any time soon?

1086
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:19,972
Not as long as the cigars
and brandy hold out.

1087
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:24,351
That's nice.

1088
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,395
What is it,
a sapphire?

1089
01:24:27,188 --> 01:24:28,314
A diamond.

1090
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:30,399
A very rare diamond.

1091
01:24:34,195 --> 01:24:36,822
Jack, I want you to draw me
like one of your French girls.

1092
01:24:38,199 --> 01:24:39,533
Wearing this.

1093
01:24:39,867 --> 01:24:41,035
All right.

1094
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:44,872
Wearing only this.

1095
01:25:20,282 --> 01:25:24,078
The last thing I need is another picture of me
looking like a porcelain doll.

1096
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:29,041
As a paying customer...

1097
01:25:32,044 --> 01:25:33,921
...I expect to get
what I want.

1098
01:25:51,772 --> 01:25:54,567
Over on the bed
...uh, the couch.

1099
01:26:03,742 --> 01:26:04,743
Come. Lie down.

1100
01:26:08,247 --> 01:26:09,748
- Tell me when it looks right.
- Keep that.

1101
01:26:09,957 --> 01:26:11,792
Put your arm back
the way it was.

1102
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:17,631
Put that other arm up,
that hand right by your face there.

1103
01:26:19,133 --> 01:26:20,134
Right.

1104
01:26:21,135 --> 01:26:23,304
Now, head down.

1105
01:26:25,931 --> 01:26:27,808
Eyes to me.
Keep them on me.

1106
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:31,979
And try to stay still.

1107
01:26:50,497 --> 01:26:52,499
So serious.

1108
01:27:33,874 --> 01:27:36,877
I believe you are blushing,
Mr. Big Artiste.

1109
01:27:41,382 --> 01:27:44,218
I can't imagine
Monsieur Monet blushing.

1110
01:27:45,552 --> 01:27:47,221
He does landscapes.

1111
01:27:47,888 --> 01:27:50,057
- Just relax your face.
- Sorry.

1112
01:27:50,391 --> 01:27:51,725
No laughing.

1113
01:28:22,756 --> 01:28:25,759
My heart was pounding
the whole time.

1114
01:28:26,093 --> 01:28:30,097
It was the most erotic
moment of my life...

1115
01:28:33,767 --> 01:28:36,103
...up until then, at least.

1116
01:28:36,603 --> 01:28:38,397
So what happened next?

1117
01:28:39,273 --> 01:28:41,942
You mean,
did we do it?

1118
01:28:44,445 --> 01:28:46,780
<i>Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine.</i>

1119
01:28:47,281 --> 01:28:49,783
<i>Jack was very professional.</i>

1120
01:28:57,791 --> 01:28:58,959
Thank you.

1121
01:29:07,092 --> 01:29:08,427
What are you doing?

1122
01:29:09,303 --> 01:29:11,597
Will you put this
back in the safe for me?

1123
01:29:23,650 --> 01:29:25,486
Gentlemen, would you excuse me.

1124
01:29:27,821 --> 01:29:29,823
None of the stewards
have seen her.

1125
01:29:30,824 --> 01:29:33,702
This is absurd.
It's a ship.

1126
01:29:33,702 --> 01:29:35,871
There's only so many
places she could be.

1127
01:29:36,163 --> 01:29:37,831
Lovejoy, find her.

1128
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:56,475
- Clear.
- Yes.

1129
01:29:58,185 --> 01:30:01,688
I don't think I've ever
seen such a flat calm.

1130
01:30:02,189 --> 01:30:03,190
Like a mill pond.

1131
01:30:04,358 --> 01:30:05,901
Not a breath of wind.

1132
01:30:07,027 --> 01:30:10,030
It will make the bergs
harder to see---

1133
01:30:10,364 --> 01:30:12,324
...with no breaking
water at the base.

1134
01:30:23,836 --> 01:30:24,920
Well, I'm off.

1135
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:28,090
Maintain speed and
heading, Mr. Lightoller.

1136
01:30:28,841 --> 01:30:30,092
Yes, sir.

1137
01:30:41,395 --> 01:30:43,730
It's getting cold.
You look nice.

1138
01:30:44,064 --> 01:30:45,399
Miss Rose?

1139
01:30:45,899 --> 01:30:47,568
My drawings!

1140
01:31:13,594 --> 01:31:14,887
Come on!

1141
01:31:17,931 --> 01:31:19,266
Wait, wait, wait!

1142
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:20,934
Wait, wait, wait!

1143
01:31:21,894 --> 01:31:23,437
- Go. Go. Down, down.
- Take us down, quickly. Quickly!

1144
01:31:31,069 --> 01:31:32,070
Bye.

1145
01:31:39,953 --> 01:31:41,288
Sorry.

1146
01:31:46,627 --> 01:31:48,295
- Keep going.
- Thank you, I've got it.

1147
01:31:58,597 --> 01:32:00,516
Pretty tough for
a valet, this fella.

1148
01:32:00,516 --> 01:32:02,267
Seems more like a cop.

1149
01:32:02,476 --> 01:32:03,602
I think he was.

1150
01:32:04,311 --> 01:32:05,938
- Oh, shit.
- Go!

1151
01:32:10,817 --> 01:32:12,319
No, over here!

1152
01:32:12,653 --> 01:32:13,820
Quick!

1153
01:32:20,327 --> 01:32:21,995
Now what?

1154
01:32:22,287 --> 01:32:23,622
Wh at?

1155
01:32:28,835 --> 01:32:30,504
More coal for number
one, mate.

1156
01:32:30,796 --> 01:32:33,298
Hold up? What are you two
doing down here?

1157
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:34,841
You shouldn't be down here.

1158
01:32:35,175 --> 01:32:36,218
It could be dangerous!

1159
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:41,640
Carry on!

1160
01:32:42,015 --> 01:32:44,059
Don't mind us. You're
doing a great job!

1161
01:32:44,059 --> 01:32:45,561
Keep up the good work!

1162
01:33:01,868 --> 01:33:03,870
Look at what we have here, huh?

1163
01:33:22,055 --> 01:33:23,390
Thank you.

1164
01:33:35,068 --> 01:33:36,903
Where to, miss?

1165
01:33:38,071 --> 01:33:39,740
To the stars.

1166
01:33:58,759 --> 01:34:00,260
You nervous?

1167
01:34:02,721 --> 01:34:03,889
No.

1168
01:34:20,781 --> 01:34:22,783
Put your hands on me, Jack.

1169
01:34:46,807 --> 01:34:48,308
<i>It's bloody cold.</i>

1170
01:34:48,809 --> 01:34:52,312
You know, I can smell ice, you know.
When it's near.

1171
01:34:53,647 --> 01:34:54,981
Bollocks!

1172
01:34:55,315 --> 01:34:56,983
Well, I can, all right?

1173
01:34:57,317 --> 01:34:59,444
Did you ever find those
binoculars for the lookouts?

1174
01:34:59,653 --> 01:35:01,488
Haven't seen them
since Southampton.

1175
01:35:02,155 --> 01:35:03,490
Well, I'll be on
my rounds.

1176
01:35:04,449 --> 01:35:05,450
Cheerio.

1177
01:35:36,690 --> 01:35:38,024
You're trembling.

1178
01:35:40,485 --> 01:35:41,653
Don't worry.

1179
01:35:41,653 --> 01:35:43,405
I'll be all right.

1180
01:36:04,718 --> 01:36:06,553
- They ran down there.
- Right.

1181
01:36:16,313 --> 01:36:17,981
Anything missing?

1182
01:36:43,006 --> 01:36:44,841
I have a better idea.

1183
01:36:57,687 --> 01:36:58,855
GOI you!

1184
01:37:08,114 --> 01:37:10,951
Did you see those guys' faces?

1185
01:37:11,535 --> 01:37:13,370
Did you see them?

1186
01:37:19,709 --> 01:37:21,545
When the ship docks...

1187
01:37:22,879 --> 01:37:24,631
...I'm getting off with you.

1188
01:37:25,715 --> 01:37:27,217
This is crazy.

1189
01:37:27,217 --> 01:37:30,053
I know. It doesn't make any sense.

1190
01:37:31,555 --> 01:37:33,056
That's why I trust it.

1191
01:37:42,065 --> 01:37:44,734
Here, look at this.

1192
01:37:45,569 --> 01:37:47,571
Look at that, would you?

1193
01:37:47,904 --> 01:37:49,406
They're warmer than we are.

1194
01:37:49,823 --> 01:37:54,160
If that's what it takes for us to get warm,
I'd rather not.

1195
01:38:06,423 --> 01:38:07,924
Bugger me!

1196
01:38:13,263 --> 01:38:14,764
Pick up, you bastards!

1197
01:38:18,435 --> 01:38:19,436
<i>Is anyone there?!</i>

1198
01:38:19,686 --> 01:38:20,854
What do you see?

1199
01:38:21,104 --> 01:38:22,522
Iceberg, right ahead!

1200
01:38:22,772 --> 01:38:23,857
Thank you.

1201
01:38:26,192 --> 01:38:27,360
Iceberg ahead!

1202
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:29,362
Hard a' starboard!

1203
01:38:36,286 --> 01:38:38,538
Turn! Turn! Srnartly!

1204
01:38:43,793 --> 01:38:44,794
Full astern!

1205
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:48,298
Hard over.

1206
01:38:48,298 --> 01:38:49,966
Helm's hard over, sir.

1207
01:38:53,637 --> 01:38:55,138
Go, lads, go!

1208
01:38:57,557 --> 01:39:00,310
Bring that steam down! Bring it down!

1209
01:39:02,145 --> 01:39:04,981
Shut all the dampers! Shut them!

1210
01:39:09,819 --> 01:39:10,820
Hold it.

1211
01:39:12,656 --> 01:39:13,657
Hold it!

1212
01:39:15,075 --> 01:39:16,826
Now! Engage reversing engine!

1213
01:39:45,855 --> 01:39:47,357
Why ain't they turning?

1214
01:39:47,607 --> 01:39:48,775
Is it hard over?!

1215
01:39:49,025 --> 01:39:51,027
It is, sir. Hard over.

1216
01:39:55,031 --> 01:39:59,202
Come on, come on, come on. Turn.

1217
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:11,715
Yes.

1218
01:40:16,886 --> 01:40:18,555
It's going to hit!

1219
01:40:29,983 --> 01:40:31,484
Jesus Christ!

1220
01:40:52,255 --> 01:40:53,423
Jesus!

1221
01:40:53,673 --> 01:40:54,674
Hard to port!

1222
01:40:54,924 --> 01:40:56,259
Hard to port!

1223
01:41:06,102 --> 01:41:07,604
Get back!

1224
01:41:37,050 --> 01:41:38,384
Let's go!

1225
01:41:38,635 --> 01:41:41,971
They're closing the doors! Get out!

1226
01:41:48,478 --> 01:41:50,814
Get out the door! Go!

1227
01:41:51,147 --> 01:41:54,150
Go! Come on, lads! Go, lads, go!

1228
01:42:03,827 --> 01:42:05,495
Go! Go!

1229
01:42:05,995 --> 01:42:07,997
Out! Out!

1230
01:42:22,679 --> 01:42:24,347
Oh, my God.

1231
01:42:25,181 --> 01:42:26,516
That was a close shave.

1232
01:42:26,850 --> 01:42:29,769
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!

1233
01:42:33,857 --> 01:42:36,693
Note the time. Enter it in the log.

1234
01:42:42,448 --> 01:42:44,117
What was that, Mr. Murdoch?

1235
01:42:45,034 --> 01:42:46,452
An iceberg, sir.

1236
01:42:47,537 --> 01:42:51,040
I put her hard to starboard, but it was too close.

1237
01:42:51,374 --> 01:42:53,543
I tried to port round it, but--

1238
01:42:53,877 --> 01:42:57,046
- Close the watertight doors.
- They're closed, sir.

1239
01:43:00,216 --> 01:43:01,384
All stop.

1240
01:43:10,727 --> 01:43:12,896
Have the carpenter sound the ship.

1241
01:43:24,574 --> 01:43:27,911
Come on, let's get the hell out of here!

1242
01:43:32,749 --> 01:43:35,585
Why have the engines stopped? I felt a shudder.

1243
01:43:35,835 --> 01:43:38,504
Not to worry. We threw a propeller blade.

1244
01:43:38,755 --> 01:43:41,591
That's the shudder you felt.
Do you need anything?

1245
01:43:42,425 --> 01:43:43,509
No, thank you.

1246
01:43:48,431 --> 01:43:50,934
There's talk of an iceberg.

1247
01:43:51,184 --> 01:43:52,936
I don't see anything. Do you?

1248
01:43:55,104 --> 01:43:58,274
If this is where the rats are going, I am, too.

1249
01:44:05,281 --> 01:44:06,950
- You.
- There is no emergency.

1250
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:10,036
- There is. I've been robbed.
- Get the Master at Arms.

1251
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:12,288
Now, you moron!

1252
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:18,294
Did I miss the fun?

1253
01:44:19,462 --> 01:44:23,132
- Did you see what happened?
- No- I guess it hit over there-

1254
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:28,554
Boiler room six is flooded eight feet
and the mail hold is worse.

1255
01:44:28,805 --> 01:44:31,224
- Can you shore up?
- Not unless the pumps get ahead.

1256
01:44:31,474 --> 01:44:34,644
- Have you seen the mail hold?
- It's already underwater.

1257
01:44:35,228 --> 01:44:36,896
This is bad.

1258
01:44:39,232 --> 01:44:40,817
We should tell Mother and Cal.

1259
01:44:41,901 --> 01:44:43,987
I think they're very good, sir.

1260
01:44:46,823 --> 01:44:49,826
Don't touch anything.
I want the room photographed.

1261
01:44:54,831 --> 01:44:57,000
We've been looking for you, miss.

1262
01:45:01,838 --> 01:45:02,922
Here we go.

1263
01:45:08,845 --> 01:45:10,263
Something serious has happened.

1264
01:45:11,848 --> 01:45:13,349
Yes, it has.

1265
01:45:14,851 --> 01:45:18,271
Indeed.
Two things dear to me have disappeared.

1266
01:45:18,521 --> 01:45:22,692
Now that one is back,
I know where to find the other. Search him.

1267
01:45:22,942 --> 01:45:24,777
- Take your coat off.
- Now what?

1268
01:45:25,945 --> 01:45:29,949
What are you doing?
We're in the middle of an emergency.

1269
01:45:30,199 --> 01:45:32,285
- Is this it?
- That's it.

1270
01:45:32,869 --> 01:45:34,704
This is horseshit!

1271
01:45:36,039 --> 01:45:37,373
Don't you believe it.

1272
01:45:37,707 --> 01:45:41,044
- He couldn't have.
- Easy enough for a professional.

1273
01:45:41,294 --> 01:45:43,796
I was with him the entire time.

1274
01:45:44,047 --> 01:45:47,050
Perhaps he did it while you were putting
your clothes back on, dear.

1275
01:45:48,718 --> 01:45:50,970
Real slick. They put it in my pocket.

1276
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:54,057
- Shut up.
- It isn't even your pocket.

1277
01:45:54,307 --> 01:45:55,808
"Property of A.L. Ryerson."

1278
01:46:00,146 --> 01:46:01,647
That was reported stolen.

1279
01:46:01,898 --> 01:46:03,483
I just borrowed it.

1280
01:46:03,733 --> 01:46:06,069
Oh, we have an honest thief.

1281
01:46:06,402 --> 01:46:08,571
You know I didn't do this, Rose.

1282
01:46:09,405 --> 01:46:11,407
Don't believe them. You know it.

1283
01:46:11,657 --> 01:46:12,658
Let's go, son.

1284
01:46:12,909 --> 01:46:14,744
You know I didn't do it!

1285
01:46:15,078 --> 01:46:18,081
There's a good lad. Come on.

1286
01:46:18,414 --> 01:46:20,750
You know I didn't do it! You know me!

1287
01:46:22,668 --> 01:46:24,921
This is most unfortunate, Captain.

1288
01:46:28,424 --> 01:46:31,844
Water fourteen feet above the keel
in ten minutes...

1289
01:46:32,095 --> 01:46:35,431
...in the forepeak,
all three holds and boiler room six.

1290
01:46:35,681 --> 01:46:36,682
That's right.

1291
01:46:36,933 --> 01:46:38,267
When can we get underway?

1292
01:46:38,518 --> 01:46:40,520
That's five compartments.

1293
01:46:42,438 --> 01:46:46,442
She can float with four compartments breached,
but not five.

1294
01:46:47,110 --> 01:46:50,780
Not five. As she goes down,
the water will spill...

1295
01:46:51,030 --> 01:46:55,201
...over the tops of the bulkheads at E deck,
one to the next...

1296
01:46:55,451 --> 01:46:58,121
...back and back. There's no stopping it.

1297
01:46:58,454 --> 01:46:59,705
The pumps.

1298
01:46:59,956 --> 01:47:03,126
The pumps buy you time, but minutes only.

1299
01:47:03,793 --> 01:47:06,045
As of now, no matter what we do...

1300
01:47:06,963 --> 01:47:09,132
...Titanic will founder.

1301
01:47:11,467 --> 01:47:12,802
But this ship can't sink.

1302
01:47:13,052 --> 01:47:15,888
She's made of iron. I assure you, she can.

1303
01:47:16,472 --> 01:47:17,473
And she will.

1304
01:47:18,307 --> 01:47:20,393
It's a mathematical certainty.

1305
01:47:24,814 --> 01:47:26,315
How much time?

1306
01:47:33,823 --> 01:47:36,325
An hour. Two, at most.

1307
01:47:42,331 --> 01:47:44,417
How many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?

1308
01:47:44,834 --> 01:47:47,670
Two thousand, two hundred souls, sir.

1309
01:47:54,343 --> 01:47:57,847
Well, I believe you may get your headlines,
Mr. lsmay.

1310
01:48:15,364 --> 01:48:17,533
Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?

1311
01:48:18,367 --> 01:48:20,536
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

1312
01:48:20,786 --> 01:48:22,955
- Mr. Hockley?
- Not now. We're busy.

1313
01:48:23,206 --> 01:48:26,626
You've been asked to put on lifebelts
and go to the boat deck.

1314
01:48:26,876 --> 01:48:27,877
I said, not now.

1315
01:48:28,127 --> 01:48:33,132
I'm sorry, Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders.
Dress warmly.

1316
01:48:33,382 --> 01:48:35,551
It's quite cold out.

1317
01:48:35,885 --> 01:48:38,721
May I suggest topcoats and hats?

1318
01:48:39,055 --> 01:48:40,890
This is ridiculous.

1319
01:48:41,557 --> 01:48:45,228
Not to worry, miss.
I'm sure it's just a precaution.

1320
01:48:45,561 --> 01:48:47,563
Everybody up! Lifebelts on!

1321
01:48:49,232 --> 01:48:50,816
What's he on about?

1322
01:48:51,734 --> 01:48:53,569
- Put your lifebelts on!
- What is it?

1323
01:48:53,819 --> 01:48:55,154
Just put them on.

1324
01:48:56,405 --> 01:48:57,573
C.O.D.?

1325
01:48:58,241 --> 01:48:59,408
Sir?

1326
01:49:01,077 --> 01:49:04,914
That's right, C.O.D. The distress call.
That's our position.

1327
01:49:10,503 --> 01:49:14,757
Tell whoever responds we're going down
and need immediate assistance.

1328
01:49:24,267 --> 01:49:25,601
Blimey.

1329
01:49:35,778 --> 01:49:37,613
Keep lowering!

1330
01:49:37,947 --> 01:49:39,949
Keep lowering!

1331
01:49:43,786 --> 01:49:47,623
Steady! Make it taut! And winch out!

1332
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:55,464
Uncover this boat! Uncover all the boats aft!

1333
01:49:55,798 --> 01:49:57,466
Release those ties!

1334
01:49:57,800 --> 01:50:00,553
Roll back that cover! Smartly now!

1335
01:50:01,137 --> 01:50:02,638
Where are the passengers?

1336
01:50:02,888 --> 01:50:06,225
They went inside- Too cold and noisy for them

1337
01:50:06,475 --> 01:50:10,813
You there! Get down here
and help with these lines!

1338
01:50:24,994 --> 01:50:26,829
Care for a drink, sir?

1339
01:50:29,332 --> 01:50:34,253
Sonny, what's doing? You get us all trussed up
and now we're cooling our heels.

1340
01:50:34,503 --> 01:50:37,006
Sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out.

1341
01:50:37,673 --> 01:50:40,009
Nobody knows what's going on.

1342
01:50:40,259 --> 01:50:43,179
Just like the damn English--everything by the book.

1343
01:50:43,429 --> 01:50:46,349
No need for language, Mr. Hockley.

1344
01:50:46,349 --> 01:50:51,187
Go back and turn on the heaters in our rooms.
I want a cup of tea when I return.

1345
01:51:02,031 --> 01:51:03,032
Mr. Andrews.

1346
01:51:05,034 --> 01:51:08,371
I saw the iceberg. And I see it in your eyes.

1347
01:51:08,704 --> 01:51:10,373
Please tell me the truth.

1348
01:51:18,547 --> 01:51:20,383
The ship will sink.

1349
01:51:22,134 --> 01:51:23,135
You're certain?

1350
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:29,058
In an hour or so, all this
will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.

1351
01:51:31,727 --> 01:51:36,065
Please, tell only who you must.
I don't want to cause a panic.

1352
01:51:36,399 --> 01:51:39,235
And get to a boat. Quickly. Don't wait.

1353
01:51:39,902 --> 01:51:43,072
You remember what I told you about the boats?

1354
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:46,742
Yes.

1355
01:51:48,577 --> 01:51:50,079
I understand.

1356
01:51:58,087 --> 01:51:59,422
Over here, son.

1357
01:52:00,423 --> 01:52:03,592
Sir, there's a big mob
at the Second Class Purser's office.

1358
01:52:03,926 --> 01:52:05,678
Go on. I'll watch him.

1359
01:52:06,429 --> 01:52:08,431
Aye. Right.

1360
01:52:22,111 --> 01:52:27,116
Sir, Carpathia says they're making 17 knots.
Full steam for them, sir.

1361
01:52:28,951 --> 01:52:30,369
She's the only one responding?

1362
01:52:30,619 --> 01:52:34,206
The only one close. They'll be here in four hours.

1363
01:52:34,957 --> 01:52:36,625
Four hours?!

1364
01:52:41,630 --> 01:52:43,132
Thank you, Bride.

1365
01:52:47,470 --> 01:52:49,138
My God.

1366
01:52:58,647 --> 01:53:00,649
We are swung out and ready, sir.

1367
01:53:02,151 --> 01:53:06,071
Hadn't we better get the women and children
into the boats?

1368
01:53:07,990 --> 01:53:08,991
Yes.

1369
01:53:13,162 --> 01:53:16,332
Women and children first, yes.

1370
01:53:17,833 --> 01:53:19,168
Yes, sir.

1371
01:53:22,004 --> 01:53:24,673
Ladies and gentlemen, attention, please!

1372
01:53:25,174 --> 01:53:27,676
Step this way, please. That's right.

1373
01:53:28,010 --> 01:53:30,846
Come towards me. Thank you.

1374
01:53:31,847 --> 01:53:32,848
Good.

1375
01:53:33,098 --> 01:53:37,353
For the time being,
I require only women and children

1376
01:53:37,853 --> 01:53:39,021
Right here.

1377
01:53:39,688 --> 01:53:43,692
Like the Captain said,
nice and cheery, so there's no panic.

1378
01:53:44,693 --> 01:53:46,028
"Wedding Dance."

1379
01:53:54,411 --> 01:53:57,039
Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on.

1380
01:53:57,373 --> 01:54:00,042
Put your lifebelts on. Lifebelt on.

1381
01:54:00,376 --> 01:54:03,379
Here, put that lifebelt on. Turn it around.

1382
01:54:08,717 --> 01:54:11,053
It isn't time to go to the boats yet!

1383
01:54:11,387 --> 01:54:13,055
Please, stay calm.

1384
01:54:13,389 --> 01:54:16,559
Make sure you have your lifebelts on.

1385
01:54:16,892 --> 01:54:19,311
Let women and children through to the front.

1386
01:54:19,562 --> 01:54:20,896
What are we doing?

1387
01:54:21,146 --> 01:54:24,233
Waiting. Once first-class people
are in the boats...

1388
01:54:24,483 --> 01:54:27,820
...they'll start with us and we want to be ready.

1389
01:54:28,988 --> 01:54:31,240
Pushing won't get you out any faster.

1390
01:54:31,574 --> 01:54:32,908
Go get help.

1391
01:54:33,242 --> 01:54:37,246
Lower it away, left and right together! Steady.

1392
01:54:37,913 --> 01:54:40,916
Both sides together! Steady!

1393
01:54:41,250 --> 01:54:42,418
Steady!

1394
01:54:42,751 --> 01:54:44,086
Steady!

1395
01:54:45,588 --> 01:54:47,590
Stop, stop, stop!

1396
01:54:48,424 --> 01:54:49,592
Hold the left!

1397
01:54:49,925 --> 01:54:52,428
Right side only! Right side only!

1398
01:54:52,761 --> 01:54:53,929
Right side!

1399
01:54:54,263 --> 01:54:58,100
Hold the left! Right side down!
Lower away together!

1400
01:55:00,269 --> 01:55:01,937
Steady, lads!

1401
01:55:49,318 --> 01:55:52,821
You know, I do believe this ship may sink.

1402
01:55:54,823 --> 01:55:59,495
I've been asked to give you
this small token of our appreciation.

1403
01:56:01,997 --> 01:56:04,667
Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.

1404
01:56:11,423 --> 01:56:14,093
Come on, sister, you heard
the man. Into the boat.

1405
01:56:14,426 --> 01:56:16,553
Any room for a gentleman,
gentlemen?

1406
01:56:16,762 --> 01:56:18,097
Only women at this time, sir.

1407
01:56:21,433 --> 01:56:23,811
Will the lifeboats be
seated according to class?

1408
01:56:25,729 --> 01:56:28,440
I hope they're not too crowded.

1409
01:56:29,233 --> 01:56:31,068
Oh, Mother, shut up!

1410
01:56:31,944 --> 01:56:33,112
Don't you understand?

1411
01:56:33,612 --> 01:56:35,322
The water is freezing and
there aren't enough boats.

1412
01:56:35,614 --> 01:56:37,241
Not enough by half.

1413
01:56:38,117 --> 01:56:40,619
Half the people on this
ship are going to die.

1414
01:56:40,953 --> 01:56:42,579
Not the better half.

1415
01:56:44,456 --> 01:56:45,499
Come on, Ruth,
get in the boat.

1416
01:56:46,083 --> 01:56:47,960
First class seats
are right up here.

1417
01:56:49,128 --> 01:56:51,088
You know, it's a pity I didn't
keep that drawing.

1418
01:56:51,088 --> 01:56:52,673
It'll be worth a lot
more by morning.

1419
01:56:56,635 --> 01:56:59,304
You unimaginable bastard.

1420
01:57:00,097 --> 01:57:02,099
Come on, Rose darling.
There's plenty of room for you.

1421
01:57:03,976 --> 01:57:05,019
Come on, Rose.

1422
01:57:05,519 --> 01:57:07,146
You're next, darling.

1423
01:57:07,479 --> 01:57:08,647
Come into the boat, Rose.

1424
01:57:11,108 --> 01:57:12,109
Come.

1425
01:57:12,443 --> 01:57:13,485
Rose.

1426
01:57:14,319 --> 01:57:15,612
Get into the boat!

1427
01:57:17,114 --> 01:57:18,115
Rose.

1428
01:57:19,283 --> 01:57:20,451
Good-bye, Mother.

1429
01:57:24,621 --> 01:57:26,123
Where are you going?

1430
01:57:26,832 --> 01:57:27,833
To him?!

1431
01:57:28,792 --> 01:57:30,294
To be a whore
to a gutter rat?

1432
01:57:31,503 --> 01:57:33,839
I'd rather be his whore
than your wife.

1433
01:57:36,216 --> 01:57:38,343
No!

1434
01:57:39,053 --> 01:57:41,055
I said, no!

1435
01:57:42,347 --> 01:57:44,683
Rose!
Please, stop!

1436
01:57:45,976 --> 01:57:47,311
And, lower away!

1437
01:57:48,645 --> 01:57:49,730
No, Wait!

1438
01:57:49,730 --> 01:57:50,814
Lower away!

1439
01:57:50,814 --> 01:57:52,691
- Rose!
- Lower together!

1440
01:57:53,358 --> 01:57:54,735
Hold the left side!

1441
01:57:58,655 --> 01:57:59,656
Help!

1442
01:58:00,532 --> 01:58:02,659
Can anybody hear me?!

1443
01:58:04,036 --> 01:58:05,704
Hello! Help me!

1444
01:58:06,538 --> 01:58:07,539
Help me!

1445
01:58:08,373 --> 01:58:10,375
Can you hear me?!

1446
01:58:10,709 --> 01:58:14,713
Can anybody hear me?!
Somebody help me!

1447
01:58:15,881 --> 01:58:17,382
Mr. Andrews?!

1448
01:58:21,053 --> 01:58:23,222
Steward, check the
starboard corridor.

1449
01:58:23,514 --> 01:58:26,016
Madame, please put on a lifebelt.
Get to the boat deck immediately.

1450
01:58:26,558 --> 01:58:29,269
Lucy, for God's sake put on your
lifebelt and set a good example.

1451
01:58:29,269 --> 01:58:30,270
Yes sir.

1452
01:58:30,896 --> 01:58:32,231
- Anyone in here?
- Mr. Andrews!

1453
01:58:32,564 --> 01:58:34,399
Mr. Andrews!
Thank God!

1454
01:58:34,691 --> 01:58:37,027
Where would the Master at Arms
take someone under arrest?

1455
01:58:37,611 --> 01:58:39,029
What? You have to get
to a boat right away.

1456
01:58:39,029 --> 01:58:40,072
No!

1457
01:58:40,072 --> 01:58:42,366
I'm doing this with or
without your help, sir.

1458
01:58:42,908 --> 01:58:43,909
But without will take longer.

1459
01:58:46,870 --> 01:58:49,206
Take the elevator to the
very bottom. Go to the left...

1460
01:58:49,206 --> 01:58:50,415
...down the crewmen's passage.

1461
01:58:50,415 --> 01:58:53,293
Then go right and left
again at the stairs.

1462
01:58:53,293 --> 01:58:54,545
You'll come
to a long corridor.

1463
01:58:59,424 --> 01:59:01,093
This could be bad.

1464
01:59:04,930 --> 01:59:07,599
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!

1465
01:59:12,938 --> 01:59:14,940
Excuse me. Thank you.

1466
01:59:18,443 --> 01:59:21,446
I'm sorry, miss,
but the lifts are closed.

1467
01:59:22,281 --> 01:59:25,242
I'm through being polite,
goddamnit!

1468
01:59:25,242 --> 01:59:26,326
Now take me down!

1469
01:59:27,619 --> 01:59:28,954
E deck.

1470
01:59:32,291 --> 01:59:33,625
Come on.

1471
01:59:34,084 --> 01:59:35,419
Come on, come on.

1472
01:59:53,270 --> 01:59:54,646
I'm going back up.

1473
01:59:54,646 --> 01:59:56,815
No! No! No!

1474
02:00:00,986 --> 02:00:02,821
Come back!
I'm going back up!

1475
02:00:03,155 --> 02:00:04,156
I'm going back up!

1476
02:00:13,165 --> 02:00:14,166
Crew passage.

1477
02:00:37,522 --> 02:00:38,523
Jack!

1478
02:00:51,328 --> 02:00:52,329
Rose!

1479
02:00:54,748 --> 02:00:56,166
Rose, I'm in here!

1480
02:00:56,750 --> 02:00:58,085
I'm in here!

1481
02:00:58,627 --> 02:00:59,711
I'm in here!

1482
02:01:01,922 --> 02:01:03,924
Jack! I'm sorry.

1483
02:01:04,258 --> 02:01:06,593
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1484
02:01:07,594 --> 02:01:09,012
That guy Lovejoy put
it in my pocket.

1485
02:01:09,012 --> 02:01:11,014
I know, I know, I know.

1486
02:01:11,014 --> 02:01:12,182
Listen Rose...

1487
02:01:12,182 --> 02:01:14,685
...you're gonna have to find
the spare key, all right?

1488
02:01:14,685 --> 02:01:16,019
Look in that
cabinet right there.

1489
02:01:17,562 --> 02:01:19,481
It's a little silver one, Rose.

1490
02:01:22,067 --> 02:01:23,568
These are all
brass ones!

1491
02:01:24,444 --> 02:01:25,946
Check right here, Rose.

1492
02:01:30,534 --> 02:01:31,535
Rose.

1493
02:01:32,869 --> 02:01:34,454
How did you find out I didn't do it?

1494
02:01:34,913 --> 02:01:36,039
I didn't.

1495
02:01:36,039 --> 02:01:38,041
I just realized
I already knew.

1496
02:01:40,627 --> 02:01:41,628
Keep looking.

1497
02:01:50,971 --> 02:01:52,014
No key.

1498
02:01:52,556 --> 02:01:53,640
There's no key!

1499
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:54,641
All right, Rose, listen.

1500
02:01:54,975 --> 02:01:56,351
You're gonna have
to go find some help.

1501
02:01:57,227 --> 02:01:58,228
It'll be all right.

1502
02:02:03,650 --> 02:02:05,068
I'll be right back.

1503
02:02:12,659 --> 02:02:14,494
I'll just wait here!

1504
02:02:27,799 --> 02:02:29,009
Hello?
ls there anyone here?

1505
02:02:30,218 --> 02:02:31,219
Hello?

1506
02:02:31,845 --> 02:02:33,472
Is there anybody
down here?

1507
02:02:34,681 --> 02:02:36,475
We need help! Hello?

1508
02:02:38,185 --> 02:02:39,186
Damnit!

1509
02:02:45,692 --> 02:02:49,529
Can anybody hear me, please?!
Hello?! Hello?!

1510
02:02:51,531 --> 02:02:52,866
Oh, thank God.

1511
02:02:53,200 --> 02:02:54,326
Wait, please, I need your help.

1512
02:02:54,618 --> 02:02:55,619
There's a man back
here and he's--

1513
02:02:56,495 --> 02:02:57,496
Wait!

1514
02:03:01,708 --> 02:03:03,043
Hello?!

1515
02:03:28,819 --> 02:03:29,861
Hello?

1516
02:03:31,321 --> 02:03:32,823
Miss, you shouldn't
be here now.

1517
02:03:33,115 --> 02:03:34,324
I need your help.

1518
02:03:34,699 --> 02:03:36,451
There is a man down
here and he is trapped.

1519
02:03:36,660 --> 02:03:37,661
- This way, yes. All right.
- Please!

1520
02:03:37,994 --> 02:03:39,830
- There's no need to panic.
- No, I'm not panicking!

1521
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:41,915
You're going the
wrong way!

1522
02:03:42,249 --> 02:03:44,000
Let go of me!
Listen!!!

1523
02:03:49,673 --> 02:03:50,674
To hell with you.

1524
02:04:28,628 --> 02:04:30,130
Oh, my God.

1525
02:05:22,182 --> 02:05:23,767
Will this work?

1526
02:05:24,684 --> 02:05:25,769
I guess we'll
find out.

1527
02:05:26,436 --> 02:05:27,437
Come on.

1528
02:05:30,524 --> 02:05:31,525
Wait, wait, wait.

1529
02:05:32,192 --> 02:05:33,693
Try a couple practice
swings over there.

1530
02:05:39,908 --> 02:05:40,909
Good.

1531
02:05:41,201 --> 02:05:42,994
Now try and hit the same mark
again, Rose. You can do it.

1532
02:05:49,709 --> 02:05:52,337
Okay, that's enough practice.
Come on, Rose.

1533
02:05:52,337 --> 02:05:53,922
You can do it.

1534
02:05:54,214 --> 02:05:57,884
Listen, just hit it really hard
and really fast.

1535
02:05:59,261 --> 02:06:00,637
Come on. Wait.

1536
02:06:00,637 --> 02:06:02,889
Open your
hands up a little more.

1537
02:06:03,223 --> 02:06:04,558
- Like that?
- Right.

1538
02:06:05,559 --> 02:06:07,602
Listen, Rose,
I trust you.

1539
02:06:12,566 --> 02:06:13,567
Go.

1540
02:06:19,906 --> 02:06:20,949
You did it!

1541
02:06:21,575 --> 02:06:22,909
Come on. Let's go.

1542
02:06:23,577 --> 02:06:25,579
Oh shit, this is cold!
Oh, shit!

1543
02:06:25,912 --> 02:06:27,497
Shit! Shit!

1544
02:06:33,086 --> 02:06:34,170
This is the way out.

1545
02:06:35,255 --> 02:06:37,757
We have to find
another way. Come on.

1546
02:06:40,802 --> 02:06:41,803
Pull.

1547
02:06:42,846 --> 02:06:43,847
Put your backs into it.

1548
02:06:49,811 --> 02:06:50,812
Pull!

1549
02:06:51,771 --> 02:06:54,608
Now, there's something
you don't see every day.

1550
02:07:16,463 --> 02:07:19,424
What's this luggage doing here?
Get rid of it. Get rid of it.

1551
02:07:19,424 --> 02:07:20,508
We need the room.
Get rid of that. Out.

1552
02:07:22,385 --> 02:07:25,388
This way.
Let go, sir. Get back.

1553
02:07:25,639 --> 02:07:26,973
Keep calm!

1554
02:07:34,314 --> 02:07:35,315
Lovejoy!

1555
02:07:35,690 --> 02:07:37,692
She's not on the starboard side either.

1556
02:07:37,984 --> 02:07:41,988
We're running out of time. This strutting
martinet isn't letting any men on at all.

1557
02:07:42,656 --> 02:07:44,658
There's one on the other
side letting men on.

1558
02:07:45,325 --> 02:07:46,785
Well then, that's our play.

1559
02:07:46,785 --> 02:07:49,454
We'll need some
insurance first. Come on.

1560
02:07:50,330 --> 02:07:52,415
This way, please.
All the way down here.

1561
02:07:55,502 --> 02:07:56,503
Here!

1562
02:07:57,712 --> 02:07:59,005
What do you
think you're doing?

1563
02:07:59,506 --> 02:08:01,508
You'll have to pay for
that, you know.

1564
02:08:01,758 --> 02:08:03,510
That's White Star
Line property.

1565
02:08:03,843 --> 02:08:05,345
Shut up!

1566
02:08:06,179 --> 02:08:09,349
Will you hold the boat a moment?
I just have to run back to my room--

1567
02:08:10,183 --> 02:08:11,226
Sit down!

1568
02:08:11,851 --> 02:08:13,061
She's the last.

1569
02:08:13,061 --> 02:08:14,979
- Prepare to lower.
- Mr. Lightoller.

1570
02:08:14,979 --> 02:08:16,898
Why are the boats being
launched half full?

1571
02:08:17,190 --> 02:08:18,191
Not now, Mr. Andrews.

1572
02:08:18,441 --> 02:08:21,611
There, look. 20 or so
in a boat built for 65?

1573
02:08:21,861 --> 02:08:23,863
And I saw one boat
with only 12. 12!

1574
02:08:24,197 --> 02:08:27,242
Well, we weren't sure of
the weight, Mr. Andrews.

1575
02:08:27,450 --> 02:08:28,576
These boats may
buckle.

1576
02:08:28,785 --> 02:08:29,786
Rubbish!

1577
02:08:30,036 --> 02:08:32,706
They were tested in Belfast
with the weight of 70 men.

1578
02:08:33,123 --> 02:08:35,583
Now, fill these boats, Mr. Lightoller.
For God's sake man!

1579
02:08:42,882 --> 02:08:45,719
Please, I need more women
and children, please!

1580
02:08:51,057 --> 02:08:52,225
Get back in there!

1581
02:08:52,559 --> 02:08:55,061
This is not an exit.
This is not an exit.

1582
02:08:57,647 --> 02:09:00,316
You can't keep us locked in here.
Like animals. The ship's bloody sinking.

1583
02:09:01,568 --> 02:09:03,570
Bring forward the women!

1584
02:09:03,903 --> 02:09:05,405
Unlock the gates.

1585
02:09:06,239 --> 02:09:08,241
Women only!

1586
02:09:08,908 --> 02:09:10,577
No men!

1587
02:09:10,910 --> 02:09:12,412
No men!

1588
02:09:16,916 --> 02:09:18,793
Get back!

1589
02:09:20,086 --> 02:09:21,254
Get back!

1590
02:09:21,254 --> 02:09:22,630
Lock the gates!

1591
02:09:23,423 --> 02:09:24,799
Get them back
from those gates!

1592
02:09:26,176 --> 02:09:27,469
Don't touch the gates!

1593
02:09:31,097 --> 02:09:32,599
For God's sake, man...

1594
02:09:32,599 --> 02:09:34,142
...there are women and
children down here!

1595
02:09:34,434 --> 02:09:36,770
Let us up so we can have a chance!

1596
02:09:37,812 --> 02:09:38,813
Get back!

1597
02:09:42,567 --> 02:09:43,777
Tommy!

1598
02:09:43,777 --> 02:09:45,278
- Can we get out?
- It's hopeless that way.

1599
02:09:45,612 --> 02:09:47,030
Whatever we do,
we've got to do it fast.

1600
02:09:50,784 --> 02:09:52,202
The boats are all going.

1601
02:09:52,535 --> 02:09:54,454
This whole place is flooding.
We've gotta get out of here.

1602
02:09:54,454 --> 02:09:55,497
There is niente this way.

1603
02:09:56,623 --> 02:09:57,874
Let's go this way, all right?
Come on!

1604
02:10:03,963 --> 02:10:05,131
I make my own luck.

1605
02:10:05,465 --> 02:10:06,966
So do I.

1606
02:10:14,808 --> 02:10:16,142
Come on!

1607
02:10:16,643 --> 02:10:17,685
No, come on, let's go this way.

1608
02:10:27,237 --> 02:10:28,404
This way!

1609
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:30,657
Just go back to
the main stairwell.

1610
02:10:31,825 --> 02:10:33,117
And everything will be
sorted out there.

1611
02:10:34,577 --> 02:10:36,412
It will all get sorted out back there.

1612
02:10:36,788 --> 02:10:38,039
Go back to the main stairwell.

1613
02:10:38,039 --> 02:10:39,999
- Open the gate!
- Go back down the main stairwell.

1614
02:10:40,250 --> 02:10:41,584
Open the gate right now!

1615
02:10:41,835 --> 02:10:43,920
Go back down the main
stairwell, like I told you.

1616
02:10:46,172 --> 02:10:48,675
Goddamn it! Son of a bitch!

1617
02:10:49,008 --> 02:10:50,677
Stop that!

1618
02:10:54,597 --> 02:10:55,723
Fabri, Tommy,
give me a hand here.

1619
02:10:55,723 --> 02:10:56,808
Move aside.

1620
02:10:56,808 --> 02:10:58,977
Come on, pull!

1621
02:10:59,853 --> 02:11:00,854
Pull!

1622
02:11:01,855 --> 02:11:03,273
Move aside.
Quickly, move aside!

1623
02:11:03,273 --> 02:11:04,357
Put that down!

1624
02:11:04,357 --> 02:11:05,692
- Move aside!
- Put that down!

1625
02:11:05,692 --> 02:11:07,026
One! Two!

1626
02:11:07,944 --> 02:11:09,112
Three!

1627
02:11:11,364 --> 02:11:12,532
Again!

1628
02:11:14,534 --> 02:11:15,577
Now, let's go!

1629
02:11:17,912 --> 02:11:19,038
Let's go, Rose.

1630
02:11:19,038 --> 02:11:21,207
You can't go up there!
You can't do this!

1631
02:11:27,547 --> 02:11:29,382
Keep order! Keep order here!

1632
02:11:29,716 --> 02:11:32,552
Back! Back! Back!

1633
02:11:37,140 --> 02:11:38,141
Hold on to her!

1634
02:11:39,726 --> 02:11:40,768
Pull her in!

1635
02:11:41,728 --> 02:11:44,230
Get back, I say, or I'll...

1636
02:11:44,564 --> 02:11:46,733
...shoot you all like dogs!

1637
02:11:47,066 --> 02:11:48,568
Keep order here!

1638
02:11:49,569 --> 02:11:51,738
Keep order, I say.

1639
02:11:52,572 --> 02:11:54,741
Mr. Lowe, man this boat.

1640
02:11:59,245 --> 02:12:03,416
Right. ls everybody all right?
Nobody panic.

1641
02:12:09,589 --> 02:12:11,257
Stay back.

1642
02:12:11,758 --> 02:12:12,926
We're too late.

1643
02:12:13,176 --> 02:12:16,262
There are more boats down the front.
Stay with this one. Murdoch.

1644
02:12:16,512 --> 02:12:18,056
He seems to be quite practical.

1645
02:12:22,769 --> 02:12:24,270
Don't lower it!

1646
02:12:24,771 --> 02:12:26,773
Cut the falls!

1647
02:12:32,278 --> 02:12:34,113
Sit down!

1648
02:12:35,448 --> 02:12:36,866
Stay back, you lot!

1649
02:12:37,116 --> 02:12:40,286
Just stay back, the
lot of you! Stay back!

1650
02:12:42,956 --> 02:12:45,625
It's starting to fall apart.
We don't have much time.

1651
02:12:47,293 --> 02:12:48,628
Mr. Murdoch?

1652
02:12:48,962 --> 02:12:51,464
Mr. Hockley.
You two, with me, now!

1653
02:12:51,714 --> 02:12:53,466
I'm a businessman, as you know...

1654
02:12:53,466 --> 02:12:55,051
...and I have a business
proposition for you.

1655
02:13:02,809 --> 02:13:03,977
Come on, Rose.

1656
02:13:07,480 --> 02:13:08,481
The boats are gone!

1657
02:13:14,153 --> 02:13:15,822
Colonel, are there
any boats on that side?

1658
02:13:16,072 --> 02:13:18,616
No, miss, but there are a couple
of boats all the way forward.

1659
02:13:18,616 --> 02:13:20,201
This way, I'll lead you.

1660
02:13:26,416 --> 02:13:29,752
What's the use?
Nobody's listening to us anyway.

1661
02:13:30,003 --> 02:13:31,671
Well, they don't listen to
us at dinner, either.

1662
02:13:31,671 --> 02:13:32,880
Come on, let's play.

1663
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:34,215
Keep us warm.

1664
02:13:35,008 --> 02:13:36,342
"Orpheus."

1665
02:13:41,180 --> 02:13:43,975
Music to drown by.
Now I know I'm in first class.

1666
02:13:49,856 --> 02:13:53,192
- Where is everyone?
- They're all still aft, sir.

1667
02:13:55,194 --> 02:13:57,363
We have an understanding
then, Mr. Murdoch.

1668
02:14:08,708 --> 02:14:12,712
Will the men please hold
back! Hold back, I say!

1669
02:14:15,048 --> 02:14:18,009
Women and children only!

1670
02:14:18,009 --> 02:14:19,927
Get back!

1671
02:14:20,219 --> 02:14:22,889
Come through, madame.
This way. Step back, sir!

1672
02:14:24,390 --> 02:14:27,226
You better check the
other side. Go!

1673
02:14:34,567 --> 02:14:36,402
I found her, on the other side.

1674
02:14:37,070 --> 02:14:38,488
Waiting for a boat.

1675
02:14:38,988 --> 02:14:39,989
With him.

1676
02:14:41,657 --> 02:14:43,743
- Any more women and children?
- They're all aboard, Mr. Murdoch.

1677
02:14:44,077 --> 02:14:45,912
Anyone else then?

1678
02:14:47,497 --> 02:14:48,915
- Anyone else?
- Do hurry. Hurry along.

1679
02:14:55,088 --> 02:14:57,090
Goddamn it all to hell.

1680
02:14:59,759 --> 02:15:01,094
Shit.

1681
02:15:01,385 --> 02:15:02,386
Fire!

1682
02:15:03,805 --> 02:15:05,723
Sir, sir, you can't
go through here.

1683
02:15:09,352 --> 02:15:11,687
That's it.
Splendid. Right.

1684
02:15:15,608 --> 02:15:17,276
Prepare to lower.

1685
02:15:19,445 --> 02:15:21,280
Ready on the left.

1686
02:15:27,203 --> 02:15:28,871
Take them down.

1687
02:15:33,709 --> 02:15:35,044
Keep it steady.

1688
02:15:37,713 --> 02:15:41,634
Both sides together.
Steady. Keep it steady.

1689
02:15:42,677 --> 02:15:44,011
- Give her to me.
- Daddy.

1690
02:15:44,846 --> 02:15:47,181
It'll be fine, darling.
Don't you worry.

1691
02:15:47,515 --> 02:15:49,183
Daddy, get in the boat.

1692
02:15:49,517 --> 02:15:52,353
It's good-bye for a little
while. Only for a little while.

1693
02:15:52,603 --> 02:15:54,647
There'll be another
boat for the daddies.

1694
02:15:55,231 --> 02:15:56,524
This boat is for the
mummies and the children.

1695
02:15:56,524 --> 02:15:58,609
You hold Mummy's hand
and be a good little girl.

1696
02:16:00,111 --> 02:16:01,445
I'm not going without you.

1697
02:16:01,696 --> 02:16:03,364
No, you have
to go, now.

1698
02:16:04,490 --> 02:16:05,867
Get in the
boat, Rose.

1699
02:16:05,867 --> 02:16:07,118
No, Jack.

1700
02:16:07,118 --> 02:16:08,202
Yes.

1701
02:16:08,202 --> 02:16:09,287
Get on the boat!

1702
02:16:09,287 --> 02:16:11,622
Yes, get on
the boat, Rose.

1703
02:16:14,458 --> 02:16:15,626
Oh my God, look at you.

1704
02:16:15,877 --> 02:16:17,795
You look a fright.

1705
02:16:17,795 --> 02:16:18,796
Here.

1706
02:16:20,548 --> 02:16:22,717
Put this on. Come.

1707
02:16:27,722 --> 02:16:29,557
Go on. I'll get the next one.

1708
02:16:29,807 --> 02:16:31,642
No, not without you.

1709
02:16:31,893 --> 02:16:33,728
I'll be all right.
Listen, I'll be fine.

1710
02:16:34,061 --> 02:16:35,897
I'm a survivor, all right?
Don't worry about me.

1711
02:16:36,230 --> 02:16:37,523
Now, go on.
Get on.

1712
02:16:38,065 --> 02:16:39,692
I have an arrangement with an
officer on the other side of the ship.

1713
02:16:40,151 --> 02:16:41,694
Jack and I can
get off safely.

1714
02:16:42,236 --> 02:16:43,237
Both of us.

1715
02:16:44,405 --> 02:16:45,573
See?

1716
02:16:45,573 --> 02:16:46,616
I got my own
boat to catch.

1717
02:16:47,408 --> 02:16:48,492
Go on, hurry.

1718
02:16:48,492 --> 02:16:49,911
They're almost full.

1719
02:16:51,412 --> 02:16:52,538
- Step aboard, miss.
- Go. Go.

1720
02:16:54,415 --> 02:16:55,583
Step aboard, please.

1721
02:16:55,875 --> 02:16:57,376
You're daddy's
good girl, all right?

1722
02:16:57,376 --> 02:16:58,502
You're my little sailor.

1723
02:17:02,757 --> 02:17:03,758
Clear the rail, please.

1724
02:17:05,426 --> 02:17:06,677
And, lower away!

1725
02:17:20,524 --> 02:17:21,859
You're a good liar.

1726
02:17:22,610 --> 02:17:24,445
Almost as good as you.

1727
02:17:29,116 --> 02:17:32,787
There's no-- there's no
arrangement, is there?

1728
02:17:34,121 --> 02:17:35,623
No, there is.

1729
02:17:35,957 --> 02:17:38,125
Not that you'll benefit much from it.

1730
02:17:40,044 --> 02:17:41,712
I always win, Jack.

1731
02:17:42,797 --> 02:17:44,465
One way or another.

1732
02:18:42,606 --> 02:18:43,649
Rose!

1733
02:18:46,027 --> 02:18:47,028
Stop her!

1734
02:18:47,778 --> 02:18:48,779
Rose, what
are you doing?!

1735
02:18:50,865 --> 02:18:51,866
No!

1736
02:19:14,889 --> 02:19:17,558
Rose! You're so stupid!
Why did you do that, huh?

1737
02:19:17,892 --> 02:19:19,894
You're so stupid, Rose.

1738
02:19:21,228 --> 02:19:22,897
Why did you
do that? Why?!

1739
02:19:24,231 --> 02:19:26,233
You jump,
I lump, right?

1740
02:19:28,069 --> 02:19:29,111
Right.

1741
02:19:31,781 --> 02:19:33,366
Oh God.
I couldn't go.

1742
02:19:34,325 --> 02:19:35,910
I couldn't
go, Jack.

1743
02:19:35,910 --> 02:19:37,578
It's all right. We'll
think of something.

1744
02:19:39,246 --> 02:19:40,748
- At least I'm with you.
- We'll think of something.

1745
02:19:55,221 --> 02:19:56,263
Come on! Move!

1746
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:00,601
Come on!
Move.

1747
02:20:07,400 --> 02:20:08,401
Come on!

1748
02:20:16,534 --> 02:20:17,535
Move!

1749
02:20:23,791 --> 02:20:25,292
Come on!
Come on Rose.

1750
02:20:27,878 --> 02:20:28,879
Rose, come on!

1751
02:20:31,882 --> 02:20:32,925
Move Rose!

1752
02:20:36,011 --> 02:20:37,012
Go!

1753
02:20:47,606 --> 02:20:50,317
I hope you enjoy your time together!

1754
02:21:04,331 --> 02:21:06,667
What could
possibly be funny?

1755
02:21:08,085 --> 02:21:09,837
I put the diamond
in the coat.

1756
02:21:12,590 --> 02:21:14,508
And I put the
coat on her!

1757
02:21:16,260 --> 02:21:17,344
Come on!

1758
02:21:37,615 --> 02:21:39,033
Dada!

1759
02:21:41,368 --> 02:21:42,495
We can't leave him.

1760
02:21:47,041 --> 02:21:48,375
All right, come on!

1761
02:21:50,044 --> 02:21:52,213
Dada!

1762
02:22:05,309 --> 02:22:06,644
Go back!

1763
02:22:17,363 --> 02:22:18,614
It's the wrong way!
Come back!

1764
02:22:18,614 --> 02:22:21,200
No, not that way!
Come back! Stop!

1765
02:22:26,247 --> 02:22:27,414
Go!

1766
02:22:29,750 --> 02:22:33,420
Go! Run!

1767
02:22:59,113 --> 02:23:00,114
This way!

1768
02:23:12,293 --> 02:23:13,460
Give me your hand!

1769
02:23:22,469 --> 02:23:23,804
Oh, God!

1770
02:23:28,142 --> 02:23:29,310
Help!

1771
02:23:35,149 --> 02:23:36,483
Help!

1772
02:23:37,943 --> 02:23:39,111
Wait, sir!

1773
02:23:39,111 --> 02:23:40,654
Sir, open the gate, please!

1774
02:23:40,904 --> 02:23:42,072
Help us, please!

1775
02:23:42,323 --> 02:23:43,657
Help us!

1776
02:23:43,657 --> 02:23:44,825
- Please!
- Please!

1777
02:23:46,493 --> 02:23:47,828
Bloody hell!

1778
02:23:53,500 --> 02:23:55,502
- Come on, come on!
- Come on!

1779
02:23:55,836 --> 02:23:57,171
Go, go!

1780
02:23:57,421 --> 02:23:58,422
<i>Jesus.</i>

1781
02:23:59,506 --> 02:24:00,507
- Please!
- Come on!

1782
02:24:00,758 --> 02:24:02,009
Hurry!

1783
02:24:02,885 --> 02:24:03,927
Come on!

1784
02:24:08,515 --> 02:24:10,267
I'm sorry, I
dropped the keys.

1785
02:24:11,518 --> 02:24:13,687
- Wait, please!
- Wait!

1786
02:24:14,021 --> 02:24:16,523
Don't leave! Please,
send for help!

1787
02:24:35,209 --> 02:24:37,211
I got it! Which
one is it, Rose?

1788
02:24:37,544 --> 02:24:39,546
The short one.
Try the short one.

1789
02:24:40,547 --> 02:24:41,548
Hurry, Jack.

1790
02:24:45,219 --> 02:24:46,887
Oh no! It won't go in.

1791
02:24:47,805 --> 02:24:48,806
Hurry, Jack.

1792
02:24:51,392 --> 02:24:53,310
It's stuck! It's stuck!

1793
02:24:54,561 --> 02:24:56,230
- Come on!
- Hurry, Jack!

1794
02:24:57,898 --> 02:24:59,566
- Hurry, Jack!
- Come on!

1795
02:25:02,236 --> 02:25:04,238
I got it! I got it!
Go! Go, Rose!

1796
02:25:05,239 --> 02:25:06,573
Go! Go!

1797
02:25:18,919 --> 02:25:21,255
Jack! Come on!

1798
02:25:23,257 --> 02:25:24,758
Move, move.

1799
02:25:34,601 --> 02:25:36,437
- Get those oars in place.
- Get an oar under it.

1800
02:25:41,608 --> 02:25:43,277
Hold it! Hold it!

1801
02:25:43,610 --> 02:25:44,945
Hold it!

1802
02:25:54,872 --> 02:25:59,126
Get these davits cranked in!
Let's get the falls hooked up!

1803
02:26:11,305 --> 02:26:13,140
Mommy!

1804
02:26:19,813 --> 02:26:20,898
Keep going up!

1805
02:26:24,151 --> 02:26:25,652
Stop pushing!

1806
02:26:27,821 --> 02:26:29,156
Stay back!

1807
02:26:29,406 --> 02:26:31,909
Will you give us a chance
to live, you limey bastard!

1808
02:26:32,159 --> 02:26:34,828
I'll shoot any man who tries
to get past me! Get back!

1809
02:26:34,828 --> 02:26:35,913
Bastard!

1810
02:26:36,163 --> 02:26:37,831
Get back!

1811
02:26:37,831 --> 02:26:38,916
We had a deal,
damn you!

1812
02:26:42,336 --> 02:26:45,464
Your money can't save you
any more than it could save me.

1813
02:26:45,464 --> 02:26:46,465
Get back!

1814
02:26:47,674 --> 02:26:49,593
Women and children only!

1815
02:26:58,519 --> 02:26:59,853
No, Tommy!

1816
02:27:18,580 --> 02:27:19,581
No, Will!

1817
02:27:26,463 --> 02:27:27,965
Now stand
back, damn you!

1818
02:27:31,301 --> 02:27:34,805
Gently, gently. Hold it. Hold it.

1819
02:27:44,481 --> 02:27:46,149
I have a child!

1820
02:27:46,483 --> 02:27:48,610
- I have a child!
- Clear a path here!

1821
02:27:48,986 --> 02:27:50,988
Please, I have a child!

1822
02:27:51,822 --> 02:27:54,491
Please. I'm all she has in the world.

1823
02:27:55,450 --> 02:27:56,493
Go on.

1824
02:27:56,827 --> 02:27:57,828
Step back!

1825
02:27:58,328 --> 02:27:59,663
- Please?
- Here, give herto me.

1826
02:28:00,372 --> 02:28:01,790
You're all right, dearie.

1827
02:28:04,877 --> 02:28:05,961
Give her here.

1828
02:28:07,880 --> 02:28:08,881
There, there.

1829
02:28:13,176 --> 02:28:16,013
Wait, wait, wait! Mr. Andrews!

1830
02:28:18,515 --> 02:28:19,516
Oh, Rose.

1831
02:28:22,519 --> 02:28:23,854
Won't you even
make a try for it?

1832
02:28:25,856 --> 02:28:30,360
I'm sorry that I didn't build you
a stronger ship, young Rose.

1833
02:28:32,195 --> 02:28:34,531
It's going fast.
We have to move.

1834
02:28:34,823 --> 02:28:35,824
Wait.

1835
02:28:38,869 --> 02:28:40,329
Good luck to you, Rose.

1836
02:28:42,372 --> 02:28:43,373
And to you.

1837
02:28:56,345 --> 02:28:57,387
Mr. Guggenheim?

1838
02:28:57,846 --> 02:28:59,014
These are for you, Mr. Guggenheim.

1839
02:28:59,222 --> 02:29:00,390
No, thank you.

1840
02:29:00,390 --> 02:29:04,269
We are dressed in our best and are
prepared to go down as gentlemen.

1841
02:29:05,062 --> 02:29:07,022
But we would
like a brandy.

1842
02:29:07,731 --> 02:29:10,233
Get the falls over here now!

1843
02:29:10,901 --> 02:29:13,362
Let them drop. Then we'll right it.

1844
02:29:18,617 --> 02:29:19,743
<i>CapitÃ©n ?</i>

1845
02:29:20,243 --> 02:29:22,579
CapitÃ©n, where should I go? Please.

1846
02:29:29,920 --> 02:29:31,922
Captain. Captain. Sir.

1847
02:30:02,411 --> 02:30:04,621
Right.
That's it, then.

1848
02:30:05,455 --> 02:30:07,082
Good-bye, Wally.
Good luck.

1849
02:30:08,125 --> 02:30:09,292
- Good-bye, Wallace.
- So long, old chap.

1850
02:31:24,534 --> 02:31:29,039
And so they lived happily
together for 300 years...

1851
02:31:29,372 --> 02:31:31,541
...in the land of Tir na nog...

1852
02:31:32,542 --> 02:31:35,212
Land of eternal
youth and beauty.

1853
02:32:10,580 --> 02:32:12,082
There's no time!

1854
02:32:12,082 --> 02:32:13,458
Cut those falls!

1855
02:32:13,708 --> 02:32:15,877
Cut them!
Cut them if you have to!

1856
02:32:16,586 --> 02:32:19,256
I need a knife!

1857
02:32:20,924 --> 02:32:22,592
Cut the falls now!

1858
02:32:23,218 --> 02:32:24,594
Cut them loose!

1859
02:32:35,105 --> 02:32:36,940
Cut those bloody falls!

1860
02:33:24,613 --> 02:33:25,947
Gentlemen...

1861
02:33:26,448 --> 02:33:29,117
...it has been a privilege
playing with you tonight.

1862
02:34:29,928 --> 02:34:31,972
We have to stay on the
ship as long as possible.

1863
02:34:31,972 --> 02:34:32,973
Come on!

1864
02:34:45,026 --> 02:34:46,695
This way.
Through the rail.

1865
02:34:48,947 --> 02:34:50,282
Come on, Rose.

1866
02:34:50,615 --> 02:34:51,616
Jump.

1867
02:34:53,952 --> 02:34:55,036
Come on.

1868
02:35:28,320 --> 02:35:29,904
I got you.
Jump.

1869
02:35:32,574 --> 02:35:34,409
I've got you, miss.

1870
02:35:38,246 --> 02:35:39,414
Back!

1871
02:36:09,611 --> 02:36:11,279
No! You'll swamp us!

1872
02:36:24,042 --> 02:36:27,128
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death--

1873
02:36:27,462 --> 02:36:30,215
You wanna walk a little faster
through that valley there?

1874
02:37:20,515 --> 02:37:22,183
Holy Mary, mother of God...

1875
02:37:22,183 --> 02:37:25,145
...pray for us sinners now and
at the hour of our death. Amen.

1876
02:37:25,854 --> 02:37:27,021
Hail Mary, full of grace...

1877
02:37:27,021 --> 02:37:28,106
This way.

1878
02:37:38,450 --> 02:37:40,535
Come on!

1879
02:37:50,211 --> 02:37:52,630
And I saw a new heaven
and a new earth...

1880
02:37:52,881 --> 02:37:56,384
...for the first heaven and the first earth
had passed away...

1881
02:37:57,469 --> 02:37:59,053
...and there was no more sea.

1882
02:38:05,560 --> 02:38:08,646
It'll be over soon.
It'll all be over soon.

1883
02:38:14,235 --> 02:38:15,904
And He shall dwell with them.

1884
02:38:15,904 --> 02:38:20,325
And they shall be His people
and God Himself shall be with them...

1885
02:38:20,658 --> 02:38:22,076
...and be their God.

1886
02:38:22,827 --> 02:38:23,912
Jack...

1887
02:38:24,913 --> 02:38:26,915
...this is where
we first met.

1888
02:38:33,963 --> 02:38:37,175
And God shall wipe away
all the tears from their eyes...

1889
02:38:37,509 --> 02:38:39,594
...and there shall be
no more death.

1890
02:38:40,094 --> 02:38:42,597
Neither shall there be
sorrow or crying.

1891
02:38:43,097 --> 02:38:45,600
Neither shall there
be any more pain...

1892
02:38:46,434 --> 02:38:49,187
...for the former world
has passed away.

1893
02:39:03,618 --> 02:39:05,954
Bloody pull faster!
And pull!

1894
02:39:29,227 --> 02:39:30,562
Hang on, miss Trudy!

1895
02:40:06,514 --> 02:40:08,016
Hold on real tight.

1896
02:40:25,533 --> 02:40:27,368
God Almighty.

1897
02:40:34,834 --> 02:40:37,378
Keep those breakers in!
Keep them in!

1898
02:41:56,374 --> 02:41:57,792
We have to move!

1899
02:42:03,715 --> 02:42:05,133
Give me your hand.
I'll pull you over.

1900
02:42:05,133 --> 02:42:06,259
I can't.

1901
02:42:06,259 --> 02:42:07,343
Come on!

1902
02:42:07,343 --> 02:42:08,386
Give me your hand.

1903
02:42:10,138 --> 02:42:12,140
I've got you.
I won't let go.

1904
02:42:12,724 --> 02:42:13,766
Come on,
I've got you.

1905
02:42:24,986 --> 02:42:28,156
- What's happening, Jack?
- I don't know. I don't know.

1906
02:42:37,331 --> 02:42:38,332
Hold on.

1907
02:43:20,708 --> 02:43:21,876
This is it!

1908
02:43:33,888 --> 02:43:37,558
Oh, my God, Jack!
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1909
02:43:38,226 --> 02:43:39,560
Hold on!

1910
02:43:54,575 --> 02:43:56,577
The ship is gonna suck us down.

1911
02:43:56,577 --> 02:43:58,788
Take a deep
breath when I say.

1912
02:44:04,418 --> 02:44:06,629
Kick for the surface
and keep kicking.

1913
02:44:06,629 --> 02:44:07,964
Do not let go
of my hand.

1914
02:44:15,680 --> 02:44:16,973
We're going to make it, Rose.

1915
02:44:16,973 --> 02:44:18,099
Trust me.

1916
02:44:18,099 --> 02:44:19,350
I trust you.

1917
02:44:24,438 --> 02:44:26,440
Ready! Ready!

1918
02:44:26,941 --> 02:44:27,942
NOW!

1919
02:45:04,312 --> 02:45:06,147
Jack! Jack!

1920
02:45:49,190 --> 02:45:50,191
Rose!

1921
02:45:50,691 --> 02:45:53,027
Get off her!
Get off her!

1922
02:45:57,239 --> 02:45:58,908
Swim, Rose! I need
you to swim!

1923
02:46:03,704 --> 02:46:05,373
Keep swimming.

1924
02:46:09,043 --> 02:46:10,378
It's so cold.

1925
02:46:10,628 --> 02:46:11,963
Swim, Rose!

1926
02:46:16,550 --> 02:46:17,885
Come on.

1927
02:46:19,887 --> 02:46:20,972
Keep swimming.

1928
02:46:21,222 --> 02:46:22,556
Come on.

1929
02:46:24,517 --> 02:46:25,685
Here...

1930
02:46:25,685 --> 02:46:26,852
...get on it.

1931
02:46:27,561 --> 02:46:29,063
Get on top.

1932
02:46:36,445 --> 02:46:37,905
Come on, Rose.

1933
02:46:47,456 --> 02:46:49,125
Stay on it.
Stay on, Rose.

1934
02:47:10,980 --> 02:47:12,481
It'll be all right now.

1935
02:47:14,984 --> 02:47:16,485
It'll be all right now.

1936
02:47:23,826 --> 02:47:24,994
Return...

1937
02:47:25,202 --> 02:47:26,871
...the boats!

1938
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,127
The boats are coming
back for us Rose.

1939
02:47:33,669 --> 02:47:35,129
Hold on just a
little bit longer.

1940
02:47:36,005 --> 02:47:38,674
They had to row
away for the suction...

1941
02:47:38,883 --> 02:47:40,968
...but now they'll
be coming back.

1942
02:47:44,013 --> 02:47:45,347
For God's sake!

1943
02:47:45,639 --> 02:47:46,849
Please...

1944
02:47:47,183 --> 02:47:48,476
...help us!

1945
02:47:53,856 --> 02:47:55,566
You don't understand.

1946
02:47:56,400 --> 02:47:58,569
If we go back, they'll
swamp the boat.

1947
02:47:58,819 --> 02:48:00,154
They'll pull us right down,
I'm telling you.

1948
02:48:00,696 --> 02:48:03,199
Oh, knock it off.
You're scaring me.

1949
02:48:03,532 --> 02:48:06,035
Come on, girls, grab
an oar. Let's go.

1950
02:48:06,327 --> 02:48:09,497
Are you out of your mind?
We're in the middle of the North Atlantic.

1951
02:48:09,705 --> 02:48:13,042
Now, do you people want to live
or do you want to die?!

1952
02:48:20,007 --> 02:48:22,218
I don't understand a one of you.

1953
02:48:24,053 --> 02:48:25,179
What's the matter with you?

1954
02:48:26,180 --> 02:48:27,598
It's your men out there!

1955
02:48:30,059 --> 02:48:31,727
There's plenty of room for more.

1956
02:48:32,019 --> 02:48:33,687
And there'll be one less
on this boat...

1957
02:48:34,021 --> 02:48:37,399
...if you don't shut that
hole in your face!

1958
02:48:53,249 --> 02:48:57,378
Now, bring in your oars over there-
And tie these boats together as well

1959
02:49:01,757 --> 02:49:04,093
Now, make sure that's
tied up nice and tight.

1960
02:49:07,596 --> 02:49:10,266
Right, listen to me, men.
We have to go back.

1961
02:49:10,599 --> 02:49:14,228
I want to transfer all the women
from this boat into that boat right now...

1962
02:49:14,228 --> 02:49:15,437
...as quick as you can, please.

1963
02:49:15,437 --> 02:49:17,940
Let's create some space over there.
Move forward and aft.

1964
02:49:27,950 --> 02:49:29,785
It's getting quiet.

1965
02:49:31,954 --> 02:49:35,291
It's just going to take a
couple of minutes...

1966
02:49:35,791 --> 02:49:37,793
...to get the boats organized.

1967
02:49:40,629 --> 02:49:42,298
I don't know about you but...

1968
02:49:42,631 --> 02:49:46,135
...I intend to write
a strongly worded letter...

1969
02:49:46,468 --> 02:49:48,095
...to the White Star Line
about all this.

1970
02:49:56,478 --> 02:49:58,147
I love you, Jack.

1971
02:50:04,820 --> 02:50:06,322
Don't you do that.

1972
02:50:07,823 --> 02:50:10,993
Don't you say your
good-byes. Not yet.

1973
02:50:11,327 --> 02:50:12,828
Do you understand me?

1974
02:50:13,162 --> 02:50:14,997
I'm so cold.

1975
02:50:15,497 --> 02:50:16,999
Listen, Rose...

1976
02:50:18,167 --> 02:50:19,835
...you're gonna
get out of here.

1977
02:50:21,003 --> 02:50:22,504
You're gonna go on...

1978
02:50:23,839 --> 02:50:25,633
...and you're gonna
make lots of babies.

1979
02:50:26,342 --> 02:50:28,344
And you're gonna
watch them grow.

1980
02:50:30,012 --> 02:50:31,305
You're gonna die an old...

1981
02:50:31,305 --> 02:50:32,556
...an old lady.

1982
02:50:32,848 --> 02:50:34,516
...Warm in her bed.

1983
02:50:36,185 --> 02:50:37,311
Not here.

1984
02:50:38,187 --> 02:50:40,689
Not this night.
Not like this.

1985
02:50:41,023 --> 02:50:42,691
Do you understand me?

1986
02:50:45,694 --> 02:50:47,863
I can't feel my body.

1987
02:50:49,531 --> 02:50:51,158
Winning that ticket, Rose...

1988
02:50:51,158 --> 02:50:53,744
...was the best thing that
ever happened to me.

1989
02:50:55,371 --> 02:50:57,206
It brought me to you.

1990
02:50:58,832 --> 02:51:01,293
And I'm thankful
for that, Rose-

1991
02:51:01,835 --> 02:51:03,170
I'm thankful.

1992
02:51:06,632 --> 02:51:07,716
You must...

1993
02:51:08,842 --> 02:51:10,844
...you must do me
this honor.

1994
02:51:13,847 --> 02:51:17,351
You must promise me
that you'll survive.

1995
02:51:19,353 --> 02:51:21,021
That you won't give up...

1996
02:51:22,189 --> 02:51:24,191
...no matter what happens.

1997
02:51:26,860 --> 02:51:29,196
No matter how hopeless.

1998
02:51:32,366 --> 02:51:34,535
Promise me now, Rose.

1999
02:51:36,704 --> 02:51:39,039
And never let go
of that promise.

2000
02:51:40,708 --> 02:51:42,042
I promise.

2001
02:51:44,169 --> 02:51:45,838
Never let go.

2002
02:51:48,716 --> 02:51:50,843
I'll never let go, Jack.

2003
02:51:53,554 --> 02:51:55,222
I'll never let go.

2004
02:52:19,330 --> 02:52:20,831
Right ahead, sir.

2005
02:52:24,001 --> 02:52:25,502
Oars!

2006
02:52:26,003 --> 02:52:27,671
Do you see any moving?

2007
02:52:28,672 --> 02:52:30,591
No, sir. None
moving, sir.

2008
02:52:31,175 --> 02:52:32,509
Check them.

2009
02:52:32,843 --> 02:52:34,345
Bring that oar up here.

2010
02:52:41,018 --> 02:52:42,019
Check them.
Make sure.

2011
02:52:43,437 --> 02:52:45,064
These are dead, sir.

2012
02:52:45,564 --> 02:52:46,732
Now, give way.

2013
02:52:47,191 --> 02:52:48,233
Ahead easy.

2014
02:52:55,032 --> 02:52:56,533
Careful with your oars.

2015
02:52:57,117 --> 02:52:58,160
Don't hit them.

2016
02:53:00,704 --> 02:53:03,040
Is there anyone
alive out there?

2017
02:53:04,541 --> 02:53:06,377
Can anyone hear me?

2018
02:53:08,545 --> 02:53:10,881
Is there anyone
alive out there?

2019
02:53:17,721 --> 02:53:18,931
We waited too long.

2020
02:53:22,851 --> 02:53:24,728
Well, keep checking them!

2021
02:53:24,728 --> 02:53:26,397
Keep looking!

2022
02:53:27,231 --> 02:53:29,733
Is there anyone
alive out there?

2023
02:53:33,237 --> 02:53:35,239
Can anyone hear me?

2024
02:53:46,417 --> 02:53:49,253
<i>Come, Josephine...</i>

2025
02:53:49,753 --> 02:53:54,258
<i>...in my ï¬ying machine</i>

2026
02:53:55,759 --> 02:53:58,971
<i>And it's up she goes</i>

2027
02:54:00,931 --> 02:54:02,933
<i>Up she goes</i>

2028
02:54:08,439 --> 02:54:10,607
<i>Come, Josephine...</i>

2029
02:54:12,943 --> 02:54:15,279
<i>___in my ï¬y'-"9""</i>

2030
02:54:39,136 --> 02:54:40,471
Jack.

2031
02:54:58,322 --> 02:54:59,656
Jack.

2032
02:55:00,157 --> 02:55:01,492
There's a boat.

2033
02:55:14,671 --> 02:55:16,006
Jack.

2034
02:55:28,519 --> 02:55:30,521
There's a
boat, Jack.

2035
02:56:14,231 --> 02:56:15,566
Come back.

2036
02:56:16,733 --> 02:56:18,235
Come back.

2037
02:56:20,404 --> 02:56:21,738
Come back.

2038
02:56:22,906 --> 02:56:24,408
Come back.

2039
02:56:25,242 --> 02:56:26,743
Come back.

2040
02:56:27,578 --> 02:56:29,913
Come back.
Come back!

2041
02:56:31,415 --> 02:56:32,916
Hello!

2042
02:56:35,043 --> 02:56:36,920
Can anyone hear me?

2043
02:56:37,421 --> 02:56:39,089
There's nothing
here, sir.

2044
02:56:41,592 --> 02:56:42,926
Come back.

2045
02:56:44,428 --> 02:56:45,762
Come back.

2046
02:56:53,604 --> 02:56:55,105
I'll never let go.

2047
02:56:55,355 --> 02:56:56,690
I promise.

2048
02:57:39,775 --> 02:57:41,610
Come about!

2049
02:58:02,964 --> 02:58:06,802
Fifteen hundred people
went into the sea...

2050
02:58:07,135 --> 02:58:10,138
...when Titanic
sank from under us.

2051
02:58:11,973 --> 02:58:15,143
There were twenty
boats floating nearby...

2052
02:58:16,311 --> 02:58:18,647
...and only one came back.

2053
02:58:20,482 --> 02:58:21,608
One.

2054
02:58:23,318 --> 02:58:25,987
Six were saved
from the water...

2055
02:58:26,488 --> 02:58:28,156
...myself included.

2056
02:58:29,324 --> 02:58:30,617
Six...

2057
02:58:31,827 --> 02:58:33,704
...out of fifteen hundred.

2058
02:58:36,998 --> 02:58:38,333
Afterward...

2059
02:58:39,501 --> 02:58:41,503
...the seven hundred
people in the boats...

2060
02:58:42,295 --> 02:58:44,381
...had nothing to
do but wait.

2061
02:58:46,007 --> 02:58:47,676
Wait to die.

2062
02:58:48,176 --> 02:58:49,678
Wait to live.

2063
02:58:50,846 --> 02:58:53,014
Wait for an absolution...

2064
02:58:53,515 --> 02:58:55,350
<i>...that would never come.</i>

2065
02:59:59,581 --> 03:00:02,209
Sir, I don't think you'll find any
of your people down here.

2066
03:00:02,209 --> 03:00:03,627
It's all steerage.

2067
03:00:06,588 --> 03:00:10,258
His hair is reddish brown,
reddish brown, reddish brown.

2068
03:00:10,258 --> 03:00:11,635
White beard.

2069
03:00:12,093 --> 03:00:13,762
Isn't there another
passenger list?

2070
03:00:13,762 --> 03:00:15,055
There is no other list.

2071
03:00:15,055 --> 03:00:16,473
Perhaps he's on
another ship.

2072
03:00:16,765 --> 03:00:18,600
We're doing all we can,
ma'am. I'm so sorry.

2073
03:00:41,957 --> 03:00:44,626
<i>That's the last time
I ever saw him.</i>

2074
03:00:45,126 --> 03:00:48,630
<i>He married, of course,
and inherited his millions.</i>

2075
03:00:49,297 --> 03:00:52,801
<i>But the Crash of '29 hit his interests hard...</i>

2076
03:00:53,134 --> 03:00:55,428
<i>...and he put a pistol in
his mouth that year.</i>

2077
03:00:55,971 --> 03:00:57,806
Or so I read.

2078
03:01:10,652 --> 03:01:12,112
Can I take your name
please, love?

2079
03:01:15,156 --> 03:01:16,491
Dawson.

2080
03:01:18,660 --> 03:01:20,161
Rose Dawson.

2081
03:01:21,496 --> 03:01:22,664
Thank you.

2082
03:01:29,671 --> 03:01:31,965
We never found
anything on Jack.

2083
03:01:31,965 --> 03:01:33,884
There's no record
of him at all.

2084
03:01:34,509 --> 03:01:36,845
No, there wouldn't
be, would there?

2085
03:01:37,178 --> 03:01:39,890
And I've never spoken
of him until now.

2086
03:01:40,640 --> 03:01:41,683
Not to anyone.

2087
03:01:42,851 --> 03:01:44,853
Not even your
grandfather.

2088
03:01:45,186 --> 03:01:49,190
A woman's heart is a
deep ocean of secrets.

2089
03:01:50,025 --> 03:01:53,695
But now you know there was
a man named Jack Dawson...

2090
03:01:54,029 --> 03:01:56,031
...and that he saved me...

2091
03:01:56,364 --> 03:01:59,701
...in every way that
a person can be saved.

2092
03:02:01,703 --> 03:02:04,372
I don't even have
a picture of him.

2093
03:02:06,875 --> 03:02:10,712
He exists now only
in my memory.

2094
03:02:15,550 --> 03:02:19,054
<i>Keldysh, Mir 2 on our
way to the surface.</i>

2095
03:02:35,570 --> 03:02:38,365
<i>I was saving this for when
I found the diamond.</i>

2096
03:02:47,749 --> 03:02:49,250
I'm sorry.

2097
03:02:51,920 --> 03:02:53,421
Three years...

2098
03:02:54,089 --> 03:02:56,758
...I've thought of
nothing except Titanic.

2099
03:02:57,592 --> 03:02:59,427
But I never got it.

2100
03:03:02,555 --> 03:03:04,432
I never let it in.
