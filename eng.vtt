WEBVTT

00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:13.717
Okay, take her up and over the bow rail.

00:02:16.178 --> 00:02:19.515
Mir 2, we're going over the bow.
Stay with us.

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.718
Okay, quiet. We're rolling.

00:02:56.177 --> 00:02:59.513
Seeing her coming out of the
darkness like a ghost ship...

00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:01.432
...still gets me every time.

00:03:03.184 --> 00:03:07.021
To see the sad ruin of the
great ship sitting here...

00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:09.690
...where she landed at
2:30 in the morning

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:11.901
Of April 15, 1912

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.528
...after her long fall...

00:03:15.321 --> 00:03:17.323
...from the world above.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.408
You are so full of shit, boss.

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:53.609
Dive 6. Here we are again
on the deck of Titanic.

00:03:54.068 --> 00:03:57.905
2% miles down
3,821 meters-

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:03.244
The pressure outside is 3% tons per square inch

00:04:04.078 --> 00:04:05.746
These windows are
9 inches thick.

00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:09.667
If they go, it's sayonara in two microseconds.

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.628
All right, enough of that bullshit.

00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:29.979
Just put her down on the roof of
the officers' quarters like yesterday.

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:35.943
Mir 2, we're landing right over the
Grand Staircase. You guys set to launch?

00:04:36.277 --> 00:04:39.697
Yeah, Brock. Launching Dunkin now.
Go, Charlie.

00:04:47.788 --> 00:04:49.623
- All right, tether out.
- Tether out.

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:53.502
Okay, Brock, we're dropping
down along the hull.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.134
Yeah, roger that- Okay, drop down and go
into the first class gangway door-

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:02.052
I want you guys working the D deck...

00:05:02.303 --> 00:05:04.680
...reception area and the dining saloon.

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:06.473
Copy that.

00:05:12.688 --> 00:05:15.858
Tether out. Okay, now left. Left, left.
Okay, coming left.

00:05:24.867 --> 00:05:28.704
Snoop Dog is on the move.
We're headed down the stairwell.

00:05:31.457 --> 00:05:33.292
Okay Lewis, drop down to B deck.

00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:36.128
- Okay, A deck.
- Give me some rope, Captain.

00:05:36.462 --> 00:05:37.963
B deck. Get in there. Get in there.

00:06:16.752 --> 00:06:18.587
Watch the door frame.

00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:20.422
- Watch it, watch it.
- I see it. I got it.

00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:27.846
- We good? Bring her down.
- We're good. Just chill, boss.

00:06:42.277 --> 00:06:44.446
Okay, make your turn.

00:06:44.947 --> 00:06:47.199
- Cable out, Captain.
- Make your turn. Watch the wall.

00:06:47.491 --> 00:06:49.827
Yeah Brock, we're at the piano.
You copy?

00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:51.954
Okay, copy that.

00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:01.547
Okay, right there. Right there.

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:03.340
Okay, that's it, that's it.
That's the bedroom door.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.925
I see it. I see it.

00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:15.102
We're in!

00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:17.521
We're in, baby. We're there.

00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:20.691
That's Hockley's bed.

00:07:20.691 --> 00:07:22.818
That's where the
son of a bitch slept.

00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:31.326
Oops. Somebody left the water running.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.079
Hold it. Hold it just a second.
Go back to the right.

00:07:40.711 --> 00:07:43.005
That wardrobe door.
Get closer.

00:07:43.422 --> 00:07:44.756
You smelling something, boss?

00:07:45.257 --> 00:07:48.177
- I want to see what's under it.
- Give me my hands, man.

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:55.184
All right.

00:07:56.852 --> 00:07:58.770
- Take it easy. It might come apart.
- Okay.

00:08:00.772 --> 00:08:03.442
Go, go, go. Flip it over.
Flip it over. Go.

00:08:04.276 --> 00:08:05.402
Turn her over. Keep going.

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:06.778
Go, Q0, 9Â°-

00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:08.197
Okay, drop it.

00:08:17.456 --> 00:08:20.542
Oh, baby, baby.
Are you seeing this, boss?

00:08:23.462 --> 00:08:25.464
It's payday, boys.

00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:42.940
Cha-ching!

00:08:43.815 --> 00:08:45.651
- We did it, Bobby.
- We brought it back, Baby.

00:08:45.984 --> 00:08:48.987
Oh, yeah! Who's the best?
Who's the best, baby?

00:08:49.321 --> 00:08:51.323
Say it. Say it. Say it.

00:08:51.657 --> 00:08:53.325
You are, Lewis.

00:08:55.911 --> 00:08:56.912
- Bobby, my cigar.
- Right here.

00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:06.838
Okay, crack her open.

00:09:36.952 --> 00:09:37.953
Shit.

00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:41.707
No diamond.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:47.462
You know boss, this same thing happened
to Geraldo and his career never recovered.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:52.884
Turn the camera off.

00:09:53.218 --> 00:09:55.721
Brock, the partners would like
to know how it's going.

00:09:57.222 --> 00:10:01.226
Hey, Dave, Barry, hi. Look, I it wasn't
in the safe. But hey, hey...

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.063
...Don't worry about it. There's still
plenty of places it could be. Hell, yes.

00:10:05.564 --> 00:10:07.858
The floor debris in the suite,
the mother's room...

00:10:07.858 --> 00:10:08.942
the purser's safe on C deck.

00:10:09.234 --> 00:10:10.319
Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase.

00:10:10.569 --> 00:10:15.407
A dozen other places. Guys, look, you're just
going to have to trust my instincts. I know we're close.

00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:17.993
We've just got to go through a little
process of elimination.

00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:21.079
Hang on a second.

00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:26.001
- Let me see that.
- Ah, we may have something here, guys.

00:10:29.755 --> 00:10:31.590
Where's the photograph
of the necklace?

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:32.591
We'll call you right back.

00:10:44.603 --> 00:10:46.438
I'll be goddamned.

00:10:49.358 --> 00:10:52.861
Treasure hunter Brock Lovett
is best known for finding Spanish gold...

00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:54.780
It's okay. I'll feed you in a minute.

00:10:55.113 --> 00:11:00.118
Now he has chartered Russian subs to reach
the most famous shipwreck of all, the Titanic.

00:11:00.452 --> 00:11:04.289
He is with us live via satellite
from the research ship Keldysh...

00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:06.708
...in the North Atlantic. Hello, Brock.

00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:10.962
Hello, Tracy. Of course, everyone knows
the familiar stories of Titanic.

00:11:11.213 --> 00:11:14.216
You know, the nobility of the
band playing to the very end and all that.

00:11:14.466 --> 00:11:18.970
But what I'm interested in are the untold stories.
The secrets locked deep inside the hull of Titanic.

00:11:19.221 --> 00:11:23.225
And we're out here using robot
technology to go further into the wreck...

00:11:23.475 --> 00:11:25.143
...than anybody has ever done before.

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:28.647
Your expedition is at the center
of a storm of controversy...

00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:32.901
...over salvage rights and even ethics.
Many are calling you a graverobber.

00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:34.986
Well, nobody ever called the
recovery of the artifacts...

00:11:35.237 --> 00:11:36.238
What is it?

00:11:36.488 --> 00:11:38.156
Turn that up, dear.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:41.159
I have museum-trained experts
sent out here making sure...

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:44.246
---that these relics are preserved
and catalogued properly.

00:11:44.246 --> 00:11:47.082
Take a look at this drawing
that we found just today.

00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:50.836
A piece of paper that's been underwater
for 84 years.

00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:53.672
And my team are able to
preserve it intact.

00:11:54.172 --> 00:11:57.342
Should this have remained unseen
at the bottom of the ocean for eternity...

00:11:57.592 --> 00:11:59.594
...when we can see and enjoy it now?

00:11:59.845 --> 00:12:01.680
I'll be goddamned.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.101
Brock!

00:12:06.685 --> 00:12:08.353
There's a satellite call for you.

00:12:08.603 --> 00:12:11.940
Bobby, we're launching. You see
these submersibles going in the water?

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.609
Trust me, buddy.
You want to take this call.

00:12:15.944 --> 00:12:17.779
This better be good.

00:12:18.113 --> 00:12:20.782
Now, you gotta speak up.
She's kind of old.

00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:22.200
Great.

00:12:23.702 --> 00:12:26.455
This is Brock Lovett.
How can I help you, Mrs...?

00:12:26.705 --> 00:12:28.832
Calvert. Rose Calvert.

00:12:28.832 --> 00:12:29.833
Mrs. Calvert.

00:12:30.876 --> 00:12:33.795
I was just wondering if you had found...

00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:36.047
...the "Heart of the Ocean" yet, Mr. Lovett.

00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:40.135
Told you you wanted to take the call.

00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:45.390
All right, you have my
attention, Rose.

00:12:45.724 --> 00:12:47.976
Can you tell us who the woman
in the picture is?

00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:51.730
Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.

00:13:08.163 --> 00:13:12.334
She's a goddamn liar!
Some nutcase seeking money or publicity.

00:13:12.751 --> 00:13:16.421
God only knows why.
Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia.

00:13:16.755 --> 00:13:18.590
They're inbound!

00:13:23.595 --> 00:13:27.516
Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the
Titanic when she was 17, right?

00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:31.269
- That's right.
- If she had lived, she'd be over 100 by now.

00:13:31.603 --> 00:13:33.772
101 next month.

00:13:34.105 --> 00:13:36.942
Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.

00:13:37.192 --> 00:13:39.361
Look, I've already done the
background on this woman...

00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:43.448
...all the way back to the 20s,
when she was working as an actress.

00:13:43.782 --> 00:13:46.618
An actress.
There's your first clue, Sherlock.

00:13:46.952 --> 00:13:51.248
Her name was Rose Dawson back then.
Then she marries this guy named Calvert.

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:54.793
They move to Cedar Rapids
and she punches out a couple of kids.

00:13:55.126 --> 00:13:58.296
Now Calvert's dead
and, from what I hear, Cedar Rapids is dead.

00:13:58.547 --> 00:14:00.882
And everybody who knows about the
diamond is supposed to be dead...

00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:03.093
...or on this boat,
but she knows.

00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:19.067
Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?

00:14:19.442 --> 00:14:20.485
Hurry up, give him a hand.

00:14:21.236 --> 00:14:24.906
Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.
Welcome to the Keldysh.

00:14:27.158 --> 00:14:28.994
Okay, let's get her inside there.

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:30.495
Hi, Miss Calvert.

00:14:31.162 --> 00:14:32.747
- Hi.
- Welcome to the Keldysh.

00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:34.833
Thanks.

00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:37.502
Hey!

00:14:45.677 --> 00:14:47.178
Are your staterooms
all right?

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:48.305
Oh, yes.

00:14:48.305 --> 00:14:49.347
Very nice.

00:14:49.598 --> 00:14:51.725
Have you met my
granddaughter, Lizzy?

00:14:51.725 --> 00:14:53.310
She takes care of me.

00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:56.438
We met just a few
minutes ago.

00:14:56.438 --> 00:14:57.647
Remember, Nana?
Up on deck?

00:14:57.939 --> 00:14:59.024
Oh, yes.

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:01.610
There. That's nice.

00:15:02.277 --> 00:15:04.696
Have to have my
pictures when I travel.

00:15:04.696 --> 00:15:05.780
Can I get you anything?

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.032
Is there anything you'd like?

00:15:08.617 --> 00:15:09.784
Yes.

00:15:10.285 --> 00:15:12.621
I would like to
see my drawing.

00:15:26.468 --> 00:15:29.387
Louis XVI wore a fabulous
stone that was...

00:15:29.596 --> 00:15:31.181
...called the Blue Diamond
of the Crown...

00:15:31.473 --> 00:15:34.142
...which disappeared
in 1792...

00:15:34.392 --> 00:15:38.063
...about the same time old Louis lost
everything from the neck up.

00:15:38.647 --> 00:15:42.150
The theory goes that the
crown diamond was chopped, too.

00:15:42.984 --> 00:15:44.653
Recut into a heart-like shape that
became known as...

00:15:45.362 --> 00:15:46.863
...the Heart of the Ocean.

00:15:47.072 --> 00:15:49.741
Today it would be worth
more than the Hope diamond.

00:15:49.991 --> 00:15:52.160
It was a dreadful,
heavy thing.

00:15:52.494 --> 00:15:54.496
I only wore it this once.

00:15:55.246 --> 00:15:57.082
You actually think
this is you, Nana?

00:15:57.332 --> 00:15:59.209
It is me, dear.

00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:01.211
Wasn't I a dish?

00:16:03.254 --> 00:16:05.924
I tracked it down
through insurance records.

00:16:06.174 --> 00:16:09.928
An old claim that was settled
under terms of absolute secrecy.

00:16:11.012 --> 00:16:13.682
Can you tell me who the
claimant was, Rose?

00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:16.601
I should imagine someone
named Hockley.

00:16:17.018 --> 00:16:18.645
Nathan Hockley,
that's right.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.106
Pittsburgh steel tycoon.

00:16:21.356 --> 00:16:23.817
The claim was for a
diamond necklace his son...

00:16:23.817 --> 00:16:25.276
...Caledon, bought his fiancÃ©e.

00:16:25.694 --> 00:16:26.695
You.

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:29.364
A week before he
sailed on Titanic.

00:16:30.365 --> 00:16:32.701
And it was filed right
after the sinking.

00:16:33.535 --> 00:16:36.621
So the diamond had to have
gone down with the ship.

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:39.207
You see the date?

00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:42.711
April 14, 1912

00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:45.880
Which means if your grandmother
is who she says she is...

00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:48.800
...she was wearing the diamond
the day the Titanic sank.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:52.178
And that makes you
my new best friend.

00:16:53.054 --> 00:16:55.181
These are some of the things
we recovered from your stateroom.

00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:00.562
This was mine.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:03.898
How extraordinary.

00:17:04.566 --> 00:17:07.986
And it looks the same as it
did the last time I saw it.

00:17:13.742 --> 00:17:16.244
The reflection has
changed a bit.

00:17:32.761 --> 00:17:35.430
Are you ready to go
back to Titanic?

00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:40.185
Okay, here we go.

00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:43.563
She hits the berg on
the starboard side, right?

00:17:43.563 --> 00:17:44.647
She kind of bumps along...

00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:45.899
...punching holes like
morse code...

00:17:46.149 --> 00:17:47.525
-- dit-dit-dit -- along the side...

00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:48.610
...below the waterline.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:52.280
Then the forward compartments
start to flood.

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:53.782
Now, as the water
level rises...

00:17:53.782 --> 00:17:55.658
...it spills over the
watertight bulkheads...

00:17:55.867 --> 00:17:58.703
which, unfortunately, don't go
any higher than E deck-

00:17:58.703 --> 00:18:00.371
So now as the
bow goes down...

00:18:00.622 --> 00:18:03.208
...the stern rises up,
slow at first...

00:18:03.208 --> 00:18:04.793
...then faster and faster...

00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:07.295
...until finally, she's got her whole
ass sticking up in the air.

00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:09.339
And that's a big ass.

00:18:10.173 --> 00:18:12.300
We're talking
20, 30,000 tons. Okay?

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:14.719
And the hull's not designed
to deal with that pressure.

00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:16.429
So, what happens?

00:18:16.888 --> 00:18:18.681
She splits, right
down to the keel.

00:18:18.681 --> 00:18:19.682
And the stern...

00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:21.226
...falls back level.

00:18:21.226 --> 00:18:22.310
Then...

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.394
...as the bow sinks...

00:18:23.394 --> 00:18:25.396
...it pulls the stern vertical...

00:18:25.396 --> 00:18:27.565
...and then finally detaches.

00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:31.653
Now the stern section just kind of bobs
there like a cork for a couple of minutes...

00:18:31.903 --> 00:18:35.073
...floods, and finally goes
under about 2:20 AM...

00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:37.492
...2 hours and 40 minutes
after the collision.

00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:40.328
The bow section
planes away...

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.289
...landing about a
half a mile away...

00:18:43.623 --> 00:18:45.375
...going 20, 30 knots when
it hits the ocean floor.

00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:51.256
Pretty cool, huh?

00:18:51.506 --> 00:18:55.844
Thank you for that fine
forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.

00:18:56.678 --> 00:19:00.014
Of course, the
experience of it was...

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:02.517
...somewhat different.

00:19:03.017 --> 00:19:05.019
Will you share it with us?

00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:01.075
I'm taking her to rest.

00:20:01.075 --> 00:20:02.160
No.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.494
Come on, Nana.

00:20:03.494 --> 00:20:04.829
No!

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:10.585
Give me the
tape recorder.

00:20:13.588 --> 00:20:14.756
Tell us, Rose.

00:20:16.758 --> 00:20:18.927
It's been 84 years--

00:20:19.761 --> 00:20:21.221
It's okay. Just try
to remember anything...

00:20:21.221 --> 00:20:22.639
...anything at all.

00:20:23.765 --> 00:20:26.601
Do you want to hear this
or not, Mr. Lovett?

00:20:30.605 --> 00:20:33.608
It's been 84 years...

00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:38.446
...and I can still smell
the fresh paint.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.076
The china had
never been used.

00:20:43.785 --> 00:20:46.454
The sheets had
never been slept in.

00:20:48.122 --> 00:20:52.043
Titanic was called
the ship of dreams.

00:20:53.544 --> 00:20:54.712
And it was.

00:20:55.964 --> 00:20:57.674
It really was.

00:21:28.037 --> 00:21:29.414
All third-class
passengers...

00:21:30.206 --> 00:21:31.749
...with a forward berth...

00:21:31.749 --> 00:21:34.043
...this way please!
This queue!

00:21:34.585 --> 00:21:36.087
It's a big boat, huh?

00:21:36.337 --> 00:21:38.423
Daddy, it's a ship.

00:21:38.423 --> 00:21:39.424
You're right.

00:22:09.454 --> 00:22:11.414
I don't see what all
the fuss is about.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.042
It doesn't look any bigger
than the Mauretania.

00:22:14.292 --> 00:22:16.127
You can be blasÃ©
about some things, Rose...

00:22:16.127 --> 00:22:17.879
...but not about Titanic.

00:22:18.129 --> 00:22:19.922
It's over 100 feet longer
than Mauretania...

00:22:19.922 --> 00:22:21.466
...and far more luxurious.

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.761
Your daughter is far too
difficult to impress, Ruth.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.097
So this is the ship they
say is unsinkable.

00:22:28.097 --> 00:22:29.223
It is unsinkable.

00:22:29.223 --> 00:22:30.725
God Himself
could not sink this ship--

00:22:30.725 --> 00:22:31.851
Wh at?!

00:22:31.851 --> 00:22:33.436
You have to check your baggage
through the main terminal.

00:22:33.436 --> 00:22:34.645
It's round that
way, sir.

00:22:35.063 --> 00:22:36.564
I put my faith in
you good sir.

00:22:36.564 --> 00:22:37.690
Now kindly
see my man.

00:22:37.899 --> 00:22:39.108
Yes sir. It's my
pleasure, sir.

00:22:39.108 --> 00:22:40.234
If I can do
anything at all...

00:22:40.234 --> 00:22:41.569
Yes, right.

00:22:41.903 --> 00:22:43.905
All the trunks from
that car there-

00:22:43.905 --> 00:22:45.948
12 from here.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.160
And the safe,
to the parlor suite...

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.912
...rooms B-52, 54, 56.

00:22:53.247 --> 00:22:54.248
Ladies...

00:22:54.457 --> 00:22:56.084
...we better hurry.

00:22:56.376 --> 00:22:57.377
Come along.

00:23:01.881 --> 00:23:03.132
- My coat?
- I have it, miss.

00:23:06.386 --> 00:23:10.556
All third-class passengers
queue here for health inspection.

00:23:16.729 --> 00:23:19.232
- Welcome aboard, ma'am.
- Welcome to Titanic.

00:23:20.691 --> 00:23:22.610
It was the ship of dreams...

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:23.986
...to everyone else.

00:23:24.779 --> 00:23:27.281
To me, it was a
slave ship...

00:23:27.615 --> 00:23:30.785
...taking me back to
America in chains.

00:23:31.786 --> 00:23:35.790
Outwardly, I was everything
a Well brought up girl should be-

00:23:36.124 --> 00:23:38.626
Inside, I was screaming.

00:23:55.143 --> 00:23:56.477
Jack, you are pazzo.

00:23:56.477 --> 00:23:58.312
You bet everything
we have.

00:23:59.397 --> 00:24:01.649
When you got nothing,
you got nothing to lose.

00:24:09.073 --> 00:24:10.116
Sven?

00:24:31.846 --> 00:24:34.182
All right,
moment of truth.

00:24:34.515 --> 00:24:36.684
Someone's life is
about to change.

00:24:36.893 --> 00:24:38.060
Fabrizio?

00:24:40.396 --> 00:24:42.523
Niente.

00:24:43.691 --> 00:24:44.692
Olaf?

00:24:45.693 --> 00:24:46.861
Nothing.

00:24:47.195 --> 00:24:48.362
Sven?

00:24:51.199 --> 00:24:53.868
Uh-oh.
2 pair.

00:24:54.702 --> 00:24:56.120
I'm sorry,
Fabrizio.

00:24:58.289 --> 00:24:59.499
I'm sorry...

00:24:59.499 --> 00:25:00.666
...you're not gonna see
your mom again for a...

00:25:01.125 --> 00:25:02.793
...long time...

00:25:02.793 --> 00:25:04.462
...'cause we're
going to America.

00:25:04.754 --> 00:25:05.838
Full house, boys!

00:25:20.061 --> 00:25:21.229
Come on.

00:25:22.146 --> 00:25:23.731
I'm going home!

00:25:26.526 --> 00:25:28.277
I'm going home.

00:25:28.277 --> 00:25:29.612
I go to America!

00:25:29.904 --> 00:25:31.239
No, mate.

00:25:31.572 --> 00:25:33.574
Titanic go to America,

00:25:33.574 --> 00:25:35.076
in 5 minutes.

00:25:35.576 --> 00:25:36.702
Shit. Fabri.
Come on.

00:25:36.702 --> 00:25:37.745
Come on,
here. Here.

00:25:40.164 --> 00:25:41.958
We're riding in
high style now!

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:44.669
We're a couple of
regular swells.

00:25:44.669 --> 00:25:46.379
We're practically
goddamn royalty...

00:25:46.379 --> 00:25:47.380
...ragazzo mio.

00:25:47.588 --> 00:25:49.590
You see?
ls my destine.

00:25:50.049 --> 00:25:51.217
Like I told you...

00:25:51.217 --> 00:25:52.969
I go to America to
be millionaire.

00:25:56.264 --> 00:25:57.515
You are pazzo.

00:25:57.515 --> 00:25:59.183
Maybe, but I've
got the tickets.

00:26:01.018 --> 00:26:02.603
Come on, I thought
you were fast.

00:26:02.603 --> 00:26:03.604
Aspettal

00:26:04.188 --> 00:26:05.690
Whoa. Wait! Wait!

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:06.691
Hey, wait!

00:26:07.233 --> 00:26:08.234
We're passengers!

00:26:11.112 --> 00:26:12.488
Have you been through
the inspection queue?

00:26:12.488 --> 00:26:13.573
Of course.

00:26:13.573 --> 00:26:15.157
Anyway, we
don't have any lice.

00:26:15.157 --> 00:26:17.118
We're Americans.
Both of us.

00:26:17.118 --> 00:26:18.202
Right.

00:26:18.202 --> 00:26:19.203
Come aboard.

00:26:23.457 --> 00:26:25.167
We're the luckiest sons
of bitches in the world.

00:26:25.167 --> 00:26:26.168
You know that?

00:26:35.303 --> 00:26:36.387
Good-bye!

00:26:40.433 --> 00:26:41.559
You know somebody?

00:26:41.559 --> 00:26:43.060
Of course not.
That's not the point.

00:26:43.311 --> 00:26:44.645
Good-bye!
I'll miss you!

00:26:44.979 --> 00:26:46.105
Good-bye!

00:26:46.564 --> 00:26:48.274
I will never forget you!

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:38.491
Come with me,
darling. Let's go.

00:27:41.035 --> 00:27:42.370
G-60.

00:27:43.371 --> 00:27:45.039
G-60. G-60.

00:27:45.373 --> 00:27:46.457
Excuse me,
ma'am.

00:27:47.375 --> 00:27:48.709
G-60.

00:27:50.044 --> 00:27:51.712
Oh, right here.

00:27:52.213 --> 00:27:53.297
Hey, how you doing?

00:27:53.506 --> 00:27:55.424
Jack. Nice
to meet you.

00:27:55.716 --> 00:27:57.218
Jack Dawson.
Nice to meet you.

00:27:57.677 --> 00:27:58.678
How you doing?

00:27:59.387 --> 00:28:01.722
Who says you get
top bunk, huh?

00:28:07.353 --> 00:28:09.605
This is your private
promenade deck, sir.

00:28:09.605 --> 00:28:11.857
Will you be requiring
anything?

00:28:12.066 --> 00:28:13.401
Excuse me.

00:28:13.818 --> 00:28:15.486
- This one?
- No.

00:28:15.736 --> 00:28:17.988
It had a lot of faces on it.

00:28:18.406 --> 00:28:19.907
This is the one.

00:28:21.575 --> 00:28:23.411
Would you like all of
them out, miss?

00:28:23.744 --> 00:28:26.914
Yes. We need a little
color in this room.

00:28:30.543 --> 00:28:31.961
Put in there.
In the wardrobe.

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.172
God, not those finger
paintings again.

00:28:35.423 --> 00:28:36.841
They certainly were a
waste of money.

00:28:37.091 --> 00:28:39.009
The difference between
Cal's taste in art...

00:28:39.009 --> 00:28:40.678
...and mine is that I have some.

00:28:40.678 --> 00:28:41.679
They're fascinating.

00:28:42.763 --> 00:28:45.182
Like being inside a dream
or something.

00:28:45.433 --> 00:28:46.767
There's truth but no logic.

00:28:47.017 --> 00:28:49.854
- What's the artist's name?
- Something Picasso.

00:28:50.104 --> 00:28:51.397
Something Picasso.

00:28:51.397 --> 00:28:53.232
He won't amount
to a thing.

00:28:53.232 --> 00:28:54.483
He won't, trust me.

00:28:54.775 --> 00:28:57.027
- Let's put the Degas in the bedroom.
- At least they were cheap.

00:28:57.778 --> 00:28:59.613
Put it in the wardrobe.

00:29:05.119 --> 00:29:09.457
At Cherbourg, a woman came aboard
named Margaret Brown.

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:11.459
We all called her Molly.

00:29:11.792 --> 00:29:14.962
History would call her
the Unsinkable Molly Brown.

00:29:15.296 --> 00:29:17.548
Well, I wasn't about to
wait all day for you, sonny.

00:29:17.548 --> 00:29:19.675
Here, if you think
you can manage.

00:29:20.301 --> 00:29:23.304
Her husband had struck gold
someplace out west.

00:29:23.637 --> 00:29:26.432
And she was what Mother
called "new money."

00:29:27.641 --> 00:29:29.018
By the next afternoon...

00:29:29.018 --> 00:29:31.729
...we were steaming west
from the coast of Ireland...

00:29:32.605 --> 00:29:36.108
...with nothing out ahead
of us but ocean.

00:29:42.323 --> 00:29:44.492
Take herto sea,
Mr. Murdoch.

00:29:45.409 --> 00:29:46.619
Let's stretch her legs.

00:29:47.077 --> 00:29:48.078
Yes sir.

00:29:50.331 --> 00:29:51.373
All ahead full, Mr. Moody.

00:29:52.124 --> 00:29:53.167
Very good, sir.

00:29:58.631 --> 00:29:59.757
All ahead full.

00:30:00.466 --> 00:30:01.884
All ahead full!

00:30:02.718 --> 00:30:03.928
Come on lads,
step lively!

00:30:22.446 --> 00:30:24.573
All right! Let's stoke
her right up!

00:30:24.782 --> 00:30:25.991
We go full ahead!

00:30:26.325 --> 00:30:28.327
Come on, put your
backs into it!

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:24.925
21 knots, sir.

00:31:33.851 --> 00:31:34.852
Hey, look,
look, look!

00:31:38.105 --> 00:31:39.440
See it?

00:31:42.776 --> 00:31:44.778
There's another
one! See him?

00:31:55.164 --> 00:31:56.957
Look at that one!
Look at him jump!

00:32:23.567 --> 00:32:25.819
I can see the Statue
of Liberty already.

00:32:26.153 --> 00:32:27.571
Very small,
of course.

00:32:31.158 --> 00:32:33.994
I'm the king
of the world!

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.043
She is the largest moving object
ever made by the hand of man...

00:33:23.293 --> 00:33:25.295
...in all history.

00:33:25.629 --> 00:33:27.840
And our master shipbuilder,
Mr. Andrews here...

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.717
...designed her from the
keel plates up.

00:33:29.967 --> 00:33:32.094
I may have knocked
her together, but---

00:33:32.094 --> 00:33:34.179
...the idea was
Mr. lsmay's.

00:33:34.638 --> 00:33:37.099
He envisioned a steamer
so grand in scale...

00:33:37.099 --> 00:33:38.225
...and so luxurious in...

00:33:38.225 --> 00:33:39.351
...its appointments...

00:33:39.351 --> 00:33:41.645
...that its supremacy
would never be challenged.

00:33:41.645 --> 00:33:43.147
And here she is.

00:33:43.397 --> 00:33:46.692
- Willed into solid reality.
- Hear, hear.

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:49.403
I'll have the salmon.

00:33:52.406 --> 00:33:54.908
You know I don't
like that, Rose.

00:33:58.412 --> 00:33:59.747
She knows.

00:34:02.583 --> 00:34:04.168
We'll both have
the lamb.

00:34:04.168 --> 00:34:06.336
Rare, with very
little mint sauce.

00:34:07.421 --> 00:34:09.006
You like lamb,
right sweet pea?

00:34:11.675 --> 00:34:13.844
You gonna cut her meat
for her too there, Cal?

00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:19.266
Hey, who thought of
the name Titanic?

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:21.268
Was it you,
Bruce?

00:34:21.268 --> 00:34:22.603
Yes, actually.

00:34:23.437 --> 00:34:27.608
I wanted to convey sheer size.
And size means stability...

00:34:28.108 --> 00:34:31.111
...luxury, and above
all, strength.

00:34:31.945 --> 00:34:34.448
Do you know of
Dr. Freud, Mr. lsmay?

00:34:34.698 --> 00:34:39.036
His ideas about the male preoccupation
with size might be of particular interest to you.

00:34:40.454 --> 00:34:41.789
What's gotten into you?

00:34:42.039 --> 00:34:43.373
Excuse me.

00:34:47.961 --> 00:34:49.296
I do apologize.

00:34:49.546 --> 00:34:51.590
She's a pistol, Cal.
Hope you can handle her.

00:34:52.466 --> 00:34:56.220
Well, I may have to start minding what she
reads from now on, won't I, Mrs. Brown?

00:34:56.637 --> 00:34:59.389
Freud? Who is he?
Is he a passenger?

00:35:11.693 --> 00:35:13.529
The ship is nice, huh?

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:15.656
Yeah. It's an Irish ship.

00:35:15.656 --> 00:35:16.782
Is English, no?

00:35:16.782 --> 00:35:17.866
No, it was built
in Ireland.

00:35:17.866 --> 00:35:19.868
15,000 lrishmen
built this ship.

00:35:19.868 --> 00:35:22.538
Solid as a rock.
Big Irish hands.

00:35:23.205 --> 00:35:24.331
That's typical.

00:35:24.331 --> 00:35:27.376
First-class dogs
come down here to take a shite.

00:35:28.127 --> 00:35:30.170
Lets us know where we rank
in the scheme of things.

00:35:30.379 --> 00:35:32.047
Like we could forget?

00:35:33.715 --> 00:35:34.883
I'm Tommy Ryan.

00:35:35.175 --> 00:35:37.219
- Jack Dawson.
- Fabrizio.

00:35:39.304 --> 00:35:40.848
Do you make any money
with your drawings?

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:53.652
Ah, forget it, boyo.

00:35:53.652 --> 00:35:56.071
You'd as like have angels fly out of
your arse as get next to...

00:35:56.071 --> 00:35:57.573
...the likes of her.

00:36:20.929 --> 00:36:24.933
I saw my whole life
as if I'd already lived it.

00:36:25.267 --> 00:36:28.770
An endless parade
of parties and cotillions...

00:36:29.104 --> 00:36:31.106
yachts and polo matches.

00:36:31.773 --> 00:36:36.445
Always the same narrow people,
the same mindless chatter.

00:36:36.945 --> 00:36:40.782
I felt like I was standing
at a great precipice...

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:45.621
...with no one to pull me back.
No one who cared...

00:36:45.954 --> 00:36:48.123
...or even noticed.

00:38:38.692 --> 00:38:39.693
Don't do it.

00:38:40.736 --> 00:38:42.070
Stay back.

00:38:43.071 --> 00:38:44.072
Don't come any closer.

00:38:45.824 --> 00:38:46.908
Come on.

00:38:46.908 --> 00:38:48.327
Just give me your hand.
I'll pull you back over.

00:38:48.535 --> 00:38:49.745
No!
Stay where you are.

00:38:51.079 --> 00:38:52.080
I mean it.

00:38:52.748 --> 00:38:54.416
I'll let go.

00:39:05.427 --> 00:39:06.928
No, you won't.

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:10.265
What do you mean,
no I won't?

00:39:10.557 --> 00:39:13.352
Don't presume to tell me
what I will and will not do.

00:39:13.352 --> 00:39:14.603
You don't know me.

00:39:14.603 --> 00:39:16.772
Well, you would have done it already.

00:39:17.439 --> 00:39:19.608
You're distracting me.
Go away.

00:39:19.941 --> 00:39:21.276
I can't.

00:39:21.276 --> 00:39:22.527
I'm involved now.

00:39:23.445 --> 00:39:26.782
You let go, and I'm going to have
to jump in there after you.

00:39:28.617 --> 00:39:30.118
Don't be absurd.

00:39:30.452 --> 00:39:32.621
- You'll be killed.
- I'm a good swimmer.

00:39:32.954 --> 00:39:34.790
The fall alone will kill you.

00:39:35.123 --> 00:39:38.293
It would hurt. I'm not
saying it wouldn't.

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.087
Tell you the truth...

00:39:40.587 --> 00:39:43.215
...I'm a lot more concerned
about that water being so cold.

00:39:50.305 --> 00:39:51.598
How cold?

00:39:51.973 --> 00:39:55.143
Freezing.
Maybe a couple degrees over.

00:39:59.648 --> 00:40:00.649
You ever, uh...

00:40:00.982 --> 00:40:02.734
...ever been
to Wisconsin?

00:40:05.987 --> 00:40:07.155
Wh at?

00:40:07.447 --> 00:40:09.658
Well, they have some of
the coldest winters around.

00:40:10.158 --> 00:40:12.828
I grew up there,
near Chippewa Falls.

00:40:13.161 --> 00:40:16.832
I remember when I was a kid,
me and my father, we went ice fishing...

00:40:17.165 --> 00:40:19.000
...out on Lake Wissota.

00:40:19.584 --> 00:40:20.836
Ice fishing is, you know, where you--

00:40:21.169 --> 00:40:22.754
I know what ice fishing is!

00:40:24.005 --> 00:40:25.173
Sorry.

00:40:26.341 --> 00:40:30.011
You just seem like, you know,
kind of an indoor girl.

00:40:32.013 --> 00:40:33.348
Anyway, I...

00:40:34.683 --> 00:40:36.351
...fell through some thin ice.

00:40:36.852 --> 00:40:38.186
And I'm telling you...

00:40:39.855 --> 00:40:41.314
...water that cold,

00:40:41.314 --> 00:40:43.191
like right down there...

00:40:43.984 --> 00:40:47.320
...it hits you like 1000 knives
stabbing you all over your body.

00:40:48.822 --> 00:40:50.157
You can't breathe.

00:40:51.199 --> 00:40:55.662
You can't think. Least not about
anything but the pain.

00:40:58.707 --> 00:41:01.960
Which is why I'm not looking
forward to jumping in there after you.

00:41:03.044 --> 00:41:04.045
Like I said...

00:41:05.881 --> 00:41:07.549
...I don't have a choice.

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:14.639
I guess I'm kind of hoping you'll
come back over the rail and...

00:41:14.639 --> 00:41:16.057
...and get me off
the hook here.

00:41:16.892 --> 00:41:18.226
You're crazy.

00:41:19.561 --> 00:41:21.730
That's what everybody says but...

00:41:23.231 --> 00:41:24.983
...with all due respect, miss...

00:41:24.983 --> 00:41:27.736
...I'm not the one hanging off
the back of a ship here.

00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:29.905
Come on.

00:41:30.572 --> 00:41:32.240
Come on, give me your hand.

00:41:33.158 --> 00:41:34.409
You don't want to do this.

00:41:50.425 --> 00:41:51.927
I'm Jack Dawson.

00:41:53.428 --> 00:41:55.096
Rose DeWitt Bu kater.

00:41:55.388 --> 00:41:57.098
I'll have to get you to
write that one down.

00:41:59.601 --> 00:42:00.769
Come on.

00:42:06.066 --> 00:42:07.067
I got you.

00:42:07.567 --> 00:42:08.568
Come on.

00:42:08.944 --> 00:42:10.278
Come on.

00:42:14.741 --> 00:42:16.076
Help, please!

00:42:16.368 --> 00:42:17.953
Help!

00:42:19.412 --> 00:42:20.580
- Please, help me!
- Listen. Listen to me.

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:22.290
Listen. Listen to me.

00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:23.959
I've got you.
I won't let go.

00:42:24.251 --> 00:42:26.253
Now pull yourself up.
Come on!

00:42:29.297 --> 00:42:30.298
Come on.

00:42:30.549 --> 00:42:31.591
That's right.

00:42:32.133 --> 00:42:33.218
You can do it.

00:42:38.139 --> 00:42:39.474
I got you.

00:42:45.146 --> 00:42:46.648
What's all this?

00:42:52.487 --> 00:42:53.655
You stand back and...

00:42:53.989 --> 00:42:55.407
...don't move an inch!

00:42:57.742 --> 00:42:58.868
Fetch the Master at Arms.

00:43:01.496 --> 00:43:03.164
This is completely unacceptable!

00:43:03.164 --> 00:43:06.001
What made you think that you could
put your hands on my fiancÃ©e?!

00:43:07.669 --> 00:43:08.837
Look at me, you filth!

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:10.338
Cal.

00:43:10.338 --> 00:43:11.464
What do you think
you were doing?

00:43:11.673 --> 00:43:14.175
Cal, stop.
It was an accident.

00:43:14.843 --> 00:43:16.511
An accident?

00:43:16.845 --> 00:43:18.179
It was.

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:20.348
Stupid, really.

00:43:21.182 --> 00:43:23.685
I was leaning over and I slipped.

00:43:26.187 --> 00:43:29.691
I was leaning far over
to see the, uh...

00:43:30.025 --> 00:43:32.360
...uh, uh, the uh...

00:43:33.194 --> 00:43:35.530
- Propellers?
- Propellers, and I slipped.

00:43:35.864 --> 00:43:38.533
And I would have gone
overboard but Mr. Dawson here...

00:43:38.867 --> 00:43:42.037
...saved me. And almost
went over himself.

00:43:42.954 --> 00:43:44.039
You wanted to see the...
She wanted to see the propellers.

00:43:44.372 --> 00:43:47.542
Like I said, women and
machinery do not mix.

00:43:48.376 --> 00:43:50.378
Was that the way of it?

00:43:52.881 --> 00:43:54.883
Yeah. Yeah, that
was pretty much it.

00:43:55.216 --> 00:43:56.718
Well, the boy's a hero then.

00:43:57.385 --> 00:43:58.637
Good for you, son.
Well done.

00:43:58.887 --> 00:44:00.889
So, it's all's well and back
to our brandy, eh?

00:44:03.558 --> 00:44:06.895
Look at you. You must be freezing.
Let's get you inside.

00:44:07.562 --> 00:44:09.898
Perhaps a little something
for the boy?

00:44:12.067 --> 00:44:13.401
Of course.

00:44:13.693 --> 00:44:17.238
Mr. Lovejoy,
I think a 20 should do it.

00:44:17.906 --> 00:44:20.575
Is that the going rate
for saving the woman you love?

00:44:22.243 --> 00:44:24.079
Rose is displeased.

00:44:24.579 --> 00:44:26.247
What to do?

00:44:26.706 --> 00:44:27.707
I know.

00:44:29.918 --> 00:44:33.588
Perhaps you could join us for
dinner tomorrow evening...

00:44:33.922 --> 00:44:35.423
...to regale our group...

00:44:35.757 --> 00:44:37.926
...with your heroic tale.

00:44:40.261 --> 00:44:42.430
Sure.
Count me in.

00:44:42.764 --> 00:44:45.100
Good.
It's settled then.

00:44:46.101 --> 00:44:47.435
This should be interesting.

00:44:56.778 --> 00:44:59.447
Can I bum a smoke?

00:45:08.289 --> 00:45:09.457
You'll want to tie those.

00:45:12.127 --> 00:45:13.211
It's interesting...

00:45:13.795 --> 00:45:15.547
...the young lady slipped
so suddenly...

00:45:15.755 --> 00:45:19.134
...and you still had time to remove
your jacket and your shoes.

00:45:35.316 --> 00:45:37.318
I know you've been melancholy.

00:45:38.319 --> 00:45:40.321
I don't pretend to know why.

00:45:42.991 --> 00:45:45.160
I intended to save this...

00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:50.331
...until the engagement
gala next week...

00:45:51.666 --> 00:45:54.002
...but, I thought...

00:45:54.335 --> 00:45:55.670
...tonight.

00:45:57.130 --> 00:45:58.339
Good gracious.

00:45:59.257 --> 00:46:02.010
Perhaps as a reminder
of my feelings for you.

00:46:02.844 --> 00:46:04.137
- Is it a--
- Diamond. Yes.

00:46:06.681 --> 00:46:09.851
56 carats to be exact.

00:46:11.853 --> 00:46:14.189
It was worn by Louis XVI.

00:46:15.023 --> 00:46:17.358
And they called
it Le Coeur de Ia Mer.

00:46:17.859 --> 00:46:19.694
- The Heart of the Ocean.
- The Heart of the Ocean. Yes.

00:46:26.201 --> 00:46:27.869
It's overwhelming.

00:46:28.328 --> 00:46:29.996
Well, it's for royalty.

00:46:31.206 --> 00:46:33.374
We are royalty, Rose.

00:46:37.378 --> 00:46:39.714
You know, there's
nothing I couldn't give you.

00:46:40.548 --> 00:46:42.550
There's nothing I'd deny you...

00:46:43.218 --> 00:46:45.386
...if you would not deny me.

00:46:49.557 --> 00:46:51.893
Open your heart to me, Rose.

00:47:07.408 --> 00:47:11.287
Well, I've been on my own since
I was 15, since my folks died.

00:47:12.413 --> 00:47:16.417
And I had no brothers or sisters or
close kin in that part of the country...

00:47:16.876 --> 00:47:20.213
...so I lit on out of there and I
haven't been back since.

00:47:20.421 --> 00:47:22.590
You could just call me a
tumbleweed blowing in the wind.

00:47:25.093 --> 00:47:29.264
Well, Rose, we've walked about a mile
around this boat deck and...

00:47:29.556 --> 00:47:32.559
...chewed over how great the weather's
been and how I grew up...

00:47:32.767 --> 00:47:36.437
...but I reckon that's not why
you came to talk to me, is it?

00:47:38.439 --> 00:47:40.441
- Mr. Dawson, I--
- Jack.

00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:42.861
Jack.

00:47:43.278 --> 00:47:46.614
I want to thank you
for what you did.

00:47:46.614 --> 00:47:51.286
Not just for pulling me back,
but for your discretion.

00:47:51.619 --> 00:47:52.954
You're welcome.

00:47:53.454 --> 00:47:54.455
Look.

00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:58.209
I know what you
must be thinking.

00:47:58.459 --> 00:48:00.253
Poor little rich girl.

00:48:00.253 --> 00:48:02.380
What does she know about misery?

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:03.631
No.

00:48:04.632 --> 00:48:06.801
No, that's not what I was thinking.

00:48:07.135 --> 00:48:08.553
What I was thinking was...

00:48:08.553 --> 00:48:11.973
---what could have happened to this girl
to make her think she had no way out?

00:48:14.642 --> 00:48:15.643
Well I...

00:48:16.394 --> 00:48:20.440
It was everything.
It was my whole world and...

00:48:20.648 --> 00:48:21.733
...all the people in it.

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:25.570
And the inertia of my life,
plunging ahead and me...

00:48:25.778 --> 00:48:27.614
...powerless to stop it.

00:48:27.822 --> 00:48:29.824
God,
look at that thing.

00:48:30.116 --> 00:48:32.285
You would have gone
straight to the bottom.

00:48:33.995 --> 00:48:36.497
500 invitations have gone out.

00:48:36.831 --> 00:48:39.500
All of Philadelphia society will be there.

00:48:39.792 --> 00:48:41.794
And all the while I feel I'm...

00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:44.172
...standing in the middle
of a crowded room...

00:48:44.172 --> 00:48:45.965
...screaming at the
top of my lungs...

00:48:45.965 --> 00:48:47.175
...and no one
even looks up.

00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:50.011
Do you love him?

00:48:51.346 --> 00:48:52.347
Pardon me?

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:54.140
Do you love him?

00:48:54.682 --> 00:48:57.685
You're being very rude. You
shouldn't be asking me this.

00:48:58.144 --> 00:49:00.688
Well, it's a simple question.
Do you love the guy or not?

00:49:03.149 --> 00:49:05.193
This is not a suitable conversation.

00:49:05.485 --> 00:49:06.694
VVhy can't you just
answer the question?

00:49:09.364 --> 00:49:11.324
This is absurd.

00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:13.034
You don't know me
and I don't know you...

00:49:13.326 --> 00:49:16.329
...and we are not having this
conversation at all. You are rude...

00:49:16.537 --> 00:49:19.874
...and uncouth and presumptuous
and I am leaving now...

00:49:20.208 --> 00:49:23.211
...Jack. Mr. Dawson.
It's been a pleasure.

00:49:23.211 --> 00:49:24.963
I sought you out to thank you
and now I have thanked you.

00:49:25.171 --> 00:49:27.173
And you've insulted me.

00:49:27.382 --> 00:49:29.008
Well, you deserved it.

00:49:29.217 --> 00:49:30.385
- Right.
- Right.

00:49:33.388 --> 00:49:35.014
I thought you were leaving.

00:49:35.223 --> 00:49:36.557
I am.

00:49:38.726 --> 00:49:40.061
You are so annoying.

00:49:41.562 --> 00:49:42.563
Wait.

00:49:42.814 --> 00:49:47.068
I don't have to leave. This is
my part of the ship. You leave.

00:49:47.402 --> 00:49:50.405
Well, well, well.
Now who's being rude?

00:49:54.242 --> 00:49:57.078
What is this stupid thing
you're carrying around?

00:49:58.246 --> 00:50:00.581
So, what are you,
an artist or something?

00:50:04.752 --> 00:50:06.587
These are rather good.

00:50:09.924 --> 00:50:13.094
They're very good, actually.

00:50:20.435 --> 00:50:22.103
Jack, this is exquisite work.

00:50:22.437 --> 00:50:25.273
Ah, they didn't think too
much of them in old Paree.

00:50:25.273 --> 00:50:26.607
Paris?

00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:30.570
You do get around
for a p--

00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:36.075
Well, a-- a
person of limited means.

00:50:36.284 --> 00:50:38.286
Go on. A poor guy. You can say it.

00:50:41.622 --> 00:50:43.291
Well, well, well.

00:50:47.628 --> 00:50:49.255
And these were drawn from life?

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.802
Well, that's one of the good things about Paris.

00:50:55.303 --> 00:50:56.721
Lots of girls are willing
to take their clothes off.

00:51:03.269 --> 00:51:04.645
You liked this woman.

00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:07.648
You used her several times.

00:51:08.816 --> 00:51:09.817
Well.

00:51:10.568 --> 00:51:12.487
She had beautiful
hands, you see?

00:51:14.989 --> 00:51:17.325
I think you must have
had a love affair with her.

00:51:17.825 --> 00:51:19.827
No, no, no.
Just with her hands.

00:51:20.161 --> 00:51:22.830
She was a
one-legged prostitute.

00:51:23.956 --> 00:51:24.957
See?

00:51:31.506 --> 00:51:33.508
She had a good
sense of humor though.

00:51:36.010 --> 00:51:37.011
Oh, and this lady...

00:51:38.846 --> 00:51:42.016
She used to sit at this bar every night...

00:51:42.016 --> 00:51:43.684
...wearing every piece
of jewelry she owned...

00:51:43.935 --> 00:51:46.270
...just waiting for
her long, lost love.

00:51:47.021 --> 00:51:49.357
We called her Madame Bijoux.

00:51:49.857 --> 00:51:51.692
See, her clothes are all moth-eaten.

00:51:53.361 --> 00:51:56.197
Well,
you have a gift, Jack.

00:51:56.531 --> 00:51:57.865
You do.

00:51:58.199 --> 00:51:59.700
You see people.

00:51:59.992 --> 00:52:01.536
I see you.

00:52:03.955 --> 00:52:05.289
And?

00:52:06.666 --> 00:52:08.376
You wouldn't have jumped.

00:52:12.713 --> 00:52:16.342
But the purpose of university
is to find a suitable husband.

00:52:16.551 --> 00:52:18.219
Rose has already done that.

00:52:18.553 --> 00:52:21.389
Look, here comes that
vulgar Brown woman.

00:52:21.722 --> 00:52:24.392
Quickly, get up before
she sits with us.

00:52:25.393 --> 00:52:28.020
Hello, girls. I was hoping
I'd catch you at tea.

00:52:28.229 --> 00:52:29.897
We're awfully sorry,
you missed it.

00:52:29.897 --> 00:52:33.317
The Countess and I were just
off to take the air on the boat deck.

00:52:33.526 --> 00:52:36.571
What a lovely idea.
I need to catch up on my gossip.

00:52:40.074 --> 00:52:41.242
Countess.

00:52:42.743 --> 00:52:45.580
So, you've not yet lit the
last four boilers?

00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:47.540
No, I don't see
the need.

00:52:48.374 --> 00:52:49.417
We are making excellent time.

00:52:50.918 --> 00:52:55.256
The press knows the size of Titanic.
Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.

00:52:55.548 --> 00:52:57.758
We must give them
something new to print.

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:01.762
This maiden voyage
of Titanic must...

00:53:02.263 --> 00:53:03.848
...make headlines.

00:53:04.098 --> 00:53:08.102
Mr. lsmay, I would prefer
not to push the engines...

00:53:08.436 --> 00:53:10.938
...until they've been properly run in.

00:53:12.273 --> 00:53:13.608
Of course I'm just a passenger.

00:53:13.608 --> 00:53:16.027
I leave it to your good offices
to decide what's best.

00:53:16.611 --> 00:53:19.447
But what a glorious end to your final crossing...

00:53:19.447 --> 00:53:21.032
...if we were to get into New York
on Tuesday night...

00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:23.784
...and surprise them all.
Make the morning papers.

00:53:24.577 --> 00:53:26.579
Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?

00:53:30.291 --> 00:53:31.626
Good man.

00:53:33.044 --> 00:53:35.546
After that, I worked
on a squid boat in Monterey...

00:53:35.963 --> 00:53:38.466
...then I went to Los Angeles to the...

00:53:38.716 --> 00:53:41.886
...Santa Monica pier
and did portraits for 10 cents each.

00:53:42.637 --> 00:53:44.472
Why can't I be like you?

00:53:44.805 --> 00:53:48.309
Just head out for the horizon
whenever I feel like it.

00:53:50.311 --> 00:53:53.064
Say we'll go there sometime, to that pier...

00:53:53.314 --> 00:53:55.483
only if we just talk about it

00:53:55.816 --> 00:53:58.653
No, we'll do it. We'll drink cheap beer.

00:53:58.986 --> 00:54:01.656
Ride on the roller coaster till we throw up

00:54:01.989 --> 00:54:05.159
We'll ride horses on the beach, in the surf.

00:54:05.493 --> 00:54:09.497
But you have to do it like a real cowboy.
No sidesaddle stuff.

00:54:09.997 --> 00:54:12.667
You mean with one leg on each side?

00:54:14.001 --> 00:54:15.002
Can you show me?

00:54:15.253 --> 00:54:17.088
Sure, if you like.

00:54:18.673 --> 00:54:20.341
Teach me to ride like a man.

00:54:20.591 --> 00:54:21.926
Chew tobacco like a man.

00:54:23.511 --> 00:54:25.680
And spit like a man.

00:54:26.013 --> 00:54:27.765
You didn't learn in finishing school?

00:54:28.015 --> 00:54:29.183
No.

00:54:29.517 --> 00:54:31.352
Come on, I'll show you.

00:54:32.353 --> 00:54:33.354
I'll show you how.

00:54:33.604 --> 00:54:36.524
Jack! No, Jack, no. Wait.

00:54:37.858 --> 00:54:39.860
I couldn't possibly, Jack.

00:54:40.194 --> 00:54:41.862
Watch closely.

00:54:43.531 --> 00:54:45.533
That's disgusting.

00:54:45.533 --> 00:54:46.534
Your turn

00:54:48.869 --> 00:54:51.872
That was pitiful.
You really have to hawk it back.

00:54:52.206 --> 00:54:55.209
Get some leverage.
Use your arms. Arc your neck.

00:54:56.544 --> 00:54:58.546
You see the range on that thing?

00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:00.548
Okay, go.

00:55:04.051 --> 00:55:09.056
That was better. You have to work on it.
Really try to hawk it up.

00:55:16.981 --> 00:55:18.316
Mother.

00:55:23.738 --> 00:55:26.073
May I introduce Jack Dawson?

00:55:27.241 --> 00:55:29.076
Charmed, I'm sure.

00:55:33.748 --> 00:55:38.419
The others were gracious and curious
about the man who'd saved my life.

00:55:39.587 --> 00:55:42.590
But my mother looked at him like an insect.

00:55:43.090 --> 00:55:47.094
A dangerous insect
which must be squashed quickly.

00:55:47.428 --> 00:55:51.265
Sounds like you're a good man
to have around in a sticky spot.

00:55:54.268 --> 00:55:58.939
Why do they always insist on announcing
dinner like a damn cavalry charge?

00:55:59.273 --> 00:56:00.941
Shall we go dress, Mother?

00:56:01.942 --> 00:56:03.778
See you at dinner, Jack.

00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:06.781
Uh, son?

00:56:07.281 --> 00:56:08.449
Son!

00:56:08.949 --> 00:56:11.285
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

00:56:12.286 --> 00:56:13.287
Not really.

00:56:13.621 --> 00:56:16.123
You're about to go into the snake pit.

00:56:18.542 --> 00:56:20.211
What are you going to wear?

00:56:23.297 --> 00:56:25.299
I figured. Come on.

00:56:27.968 --> 00:56:32.306
I was right. You and my son
are just about the same size.

00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:34.308
Pretty close.

00:56:37.978 --> 00:56:40.314
You shine up like a new penny.

00:56:52.159 --> 00:56:53.828
Good evening, sir.

00:57:58.142 --> 00:58:00.895
Thousands of tons of Hockley steel
are in this ship.

00:58:01.145 --> 00:58:03.230
- Which part?
- All the right ones.

00:58:03.481 --> 00:58:06.650
Then you're accountable
if there's a problem. Where's Rose?

00:58:06.901 --> 00:58:08.235
She'll be along.

00:58:08.569 --> 00:58:10.571
There is the Countess.

00:58:39.433 --> 00:58:42.937
I saw that in a nickelodeon
and always wanted to do it.

00:58:57.368 --> 00:58:58.536
Darling...

00:58:59.119 --> 00:59:01.288
...surely you remember Mr. Dawson.

00:59:04.124 --> 00:59:07.711
It's amazing.
You could almost pass for a gentleman.

00:59:08.963 --> 00:59:10.130
Almost.

00:59:10.464 --> 00:59:11.882
This is extraordinary.

00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:28.148
This is a remarkable voyage.

00:59:28.399 --> 00:59:29.817
- Mad.
- Completely lunatic.

00:59:31.569 --> 00:59:33.571
There's the Countess of Rothes.

00:59:35.656 --> 00:59:38.659
That's John Jacob Astor...

00:59:39.326 --> 00:59:40.995
...the richest man on board.

00:59:41.245 --> 00:59:45.165
His little wifey, Madeleine,
is my age and in a delicate condition.

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.002
See how she tries to hide it.

00:59:48.252 --> 00:59:49.670
Quite the scandal.

00:59:50.170 --> 00:59:54.675
Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress,
Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim...

00:59:54.925 --> 00:59:58.596
...is at home with the children, of course.
And over here...

00:59:58.846 --> 01:00:00.514
...Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon.

01:00:00.764 --> 01:00:04.101
She designs naughty lingerie,
among her many talents.

01:00:04.351 --> 01:00:06.687
Very popular with the royals.

01:00:07.688 --> 01:00:09.523
Congratulations. She's splendid.

01:00:09.857 --> 01:00:11.358
Why, thank you.

01:00:12.192 --> 01:00:13.611
Escort a lady to dinner?

01:00:13.861 --> 01:00:15.362
Certainly.

01:00:16.697 --> 01:00:18.699
Sweet pea, sweet pea.

01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:20.951
Ain't nothing to it.

01:00:21.702 --> 01:00:26.206
They love money. Pretend like you own
a gold mine and you're in the club.

01:00:28.375 --> 01:00:30.044
Hey, Astor.

01:00:30.878 --> 01:00:33.547
Hello, Molly. Nice to see you.

01:00:33.797 --> 01:00:36.717
J.J., Madeleine,
I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.

01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:39.470
Well, Jack...

01:00:39.887 --> 01:00:41.555
...are you of the Boston Dawsons?

01:00:42.556 --> 01:00:45.142
No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.

01:00:45.392 --> 01:00:46.727
Oh, yes.

01:00:48.729 --> 01:00:52.733
He must have been nervous,
but he never faltered.

01:00:53.567 --> 01:00:55.736
They assumed he was one of them.

01:00:56.070 --> 01:00:59.239
Heir to a rail road fortune, perhaps.

01:00:59.573 --> 01:01:03.744
New money, obviously,
but still a member of the club.

01:01:04.411 --> 01:01:07.831
Mother, of course,
could always be counted upon.

01:01:08.415 --> 01:01:13.337
Tell us of the accommodations in steerage
Mr- Dawson- I hear they're quite good-

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:18.008
The best I've seen, ma'am. Hardly any rats.

01:01:21.095 --> 01:01:23.931
Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class.

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:26.517
He was of help to my fiancÃ©e last night.

01:01:26.767 --> 01:01:29.603
It happens Mr. Dawson is quite a fine artist.

01:01:29.937 --> 01:01:32.439
He showed me some of his work today.

01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:37.778
Rose and I differ in our definition of fine art.
Not to impugn your work, sir.

01:01:48.622 --> 01:01:49.623
Are all these mine?

01:01:49.873 --> 01:01:51.959
Start from the outside and work in.

01:01:52.209 --> 01:01:54.211
He knows every rivet in her.

01:01:54.461 --> 01:01:56.797
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews.

01:01:57.047 --> 01:01:58.382
Thank you, Rose.

01:02:01.552 --> 01:02:03.137
How do you take your caviar, sir?

01:02:03.387 --> 01:02:06.640
No caviar for me, thanks.
Never did like it much.

01:02:08.475 --> 01:02:11.145
Where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson?

01:02:11.562 --> 01:02:14.565
Right now, my address is the RMS Titanic.

01:02:14.815 --> 01:02:16.817
After that, I'm on God's good humor.

01:02:17.317 --> 01:02:19.236
How do you have means to travel?

01:02:20.154 --> 01:02:24.324
I work my way from place to place.
Tramp steamers and such.

01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:28.328
I won my ticket on Titanic
at a lucky hand at poker.

01:02:28.579 --> 01:02:30.080
A very lucky hand.

01:02:30.998 --> 01:02:33.000
All life is a game of luck.

01:02:34.168 --> 01:02:37.087
A real man makes his own luck.
Right, Dawson?

01:02:38.756 --> 01:02:42.593
And you find
that sort of rootless existence appealing?

01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:47.264
Yes, ma'am, I do.

01:02:48.015 --> 01:02:51.018
I've got everything I need
right here with me.

01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:54.104
I have air in my lungs
and blank sheets of paper.

01:02:55.522 --> 01:02:59.943
I love waking up, not knowing
what will happen or who I'll meet.

01:03:00.861 --> 01:03:02.279
Where I'll wind up.

01:03:02.696 --> 01:03:04.948
One night I'm sleeping under a bridge...

01:03:05.199 --> 01:03:09.453
...now I'm on the grandest ship
in the world, with you fine people.

01:03:09.703 --> 01:03:10.704
I'll take more of that.

01:03:12.039 --> 01:03:15.042
Life's a gift. I don't intend on wasting it.

01:03:16.376 --> 01:03:18.879
You never know what hand you'll get dealt.

01:03:19.213 --> 01:03:21.882
You take life as it comes at you. Here, Cal.

01:03:24.468 --> 01:03:26.136
Make each day count.

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:27.971
Well said, Jack.

01:03:28.222 --> 01:03:29.306
Hear, hear.

01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:31.892
To making it count.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.229
To making it count.

01:03:35.729 --> 01:03:36.730
Bravo.

01:03:43.654 --> 01:03:47.407
But Mr. Brown didn't know
I'd hidden the money in the stove.

01:03:48.742 --> 01:03:52.746
He comes home drunk as a pig celebrating
and lights a fire.

01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:58.418
Next is brandy in the smoking room.

01:04:00.587 --> 01:04:02.673
Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?

01:04:04.591 --> 01:04:09.012
Now they retreat to congratulate each
other on being masters of the universe.

01:04:09.263 --> 01:04:11.265
Ladies, thank you for your company.

01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:14.017
May I escort you to the cabin?

01:04:14.268 --> 01:04:15.269
No, I'll stay here.

01:04:16.103 --> 01:04:17.104
Here, Molly.

01:04:18.105 --> 01:04:20.107
Joining us, Dawson?

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:22.776
You don't want to stay with the women.

01:04:23.277 --> 01:04:25.612
No, thanks. I have to head back.

01:04:25.946 --> 01:04:30.617
That's best. It'll be all business and politics.
Wouldn't interest you.

01:04:31.702 --> 01:04:34.371
But Dawson, good of you to come.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.295
Must you go?

01:04:41.545 --> 01:04:43.881
Time for me to row with the other slaves.

01:04:47.467 --> 01:04:48.802
Good night, Rose.

01:05:28.842 --> 01:05:31.345
Want to go to a real party?

01:05:41.772 --> 01:05:43.941
Is okay I put my hand here?

01:06:03.543 --> 01:06:05.545
I can't understand you.

01:06:37.828 --> 01:06:40.330
I'm going to dance with her now.

01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:41.331
Come on.

01:06:41.915 --> 01:06:43.917
Come on. Come with me.

01:06:44.251 --> 01:06:46.086
Jack. Jack, wait.

01:06:48.422 --> 01:06:49.423
I can't do this.

01:06:49.673 --> 01:06:51.508
We'll have to get a bit closer.

01:06:51.758 --> 01:06:52.926
Like this.

01:06:56.263 --> 01:06:57.931
You're still my best girl, Cora.

01:07:01.184 --> 01:07:04.354
- I don't know the steps.
- Me, either. Just go with it.

01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:06.189
Don't think.

01:07:25.292 --> 01:07:27.961
Wait! Jack! Wait! Stop, Jack!

01:07:37.804 --> 01:07:39.306
Wh at? Wait!

01:08:20.514 --> 01:08:22.182
Jack, no.

01:08:28.021 --> 01:08:31.691
--Beyond the jurisdiction
of the Sherman Act.

01:08:32.025 --> 01:08:35.779
That's what Rockefeller said--
Supreme Court didn't swallow it.

01:08:56.049 --> 01:08:59.719
What? You think
a first-class girl can't drink?

01:09:01.972 --> 01:09:02.973
Get out of here.

01:09:03.557 --> 01:09:04.891
Are you all right?

01:09:06.893 --> 01:09:07.894
I'm fine.

01:09:08.145 --> 01:09:10.147
Two out of three.

01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:12.399
So...

01:09:13.567 --> 01:09:15.569
...you think you're tough?

01:09:16.903 --> 01:09:18.405
Let's see you do this.

01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:23.410
Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.

01:09:41.094 --> 01:09:42.179
Jesus!

01:09:42.429 --> 01:09:43.597
You okay?

01:09:43.847 --> 01:09:45.432
I haven't done that in years.

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:56.276
Come on, lads. Give it all you got. Let's go.

01:10:22.302 --> 01:10:23.637
Coffee, sir?

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:35.232
You didn't come to me last night.

01:10:37.484 --> 01:10:38.985
I was tired.

01:10:41.488 --> 01:10:44.157
Your exertions below deck
were no doubt exhausting.

01:10:47.327 --> 01:10:50.830
I see you had
that undertaker of a manservant follow me.

01:10:51.164 --> 01:10:54.084
You will never behave like that again.

01:10:57.671 --> 01:11:00.674
I'm not one of your mill foremen
who you can command.

01:11:02.175 --> 01:11:03.843
I'm your fiancÃ©e.

01:11:05.512 --> 01:11:07.514
My fiancÃ©e. My fiancÃ©e!

01:11:07.847 --> 01:11:09.849
Yes, you are! And my wife!

01:11:11.184 --> 01:11:15.689
My wife in practice,
if not yet by law, so you will honor me!

01:11:16.022 --> 01:11:18.775
You will honor me the way
a wife honors her husband.

01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:21.278
Because I will not be made a fool of.

01:11:22.112 --> 01:11:23.947
Is this in any way unclear?

01:11:24.864 --> 01:11:26.032
No.

01:11:26.366 --> 01:11:28.702
Good. Excuse me.

01:11:34.374 --> 01:11:36.042
Oh, Miss Rose.

01:11:37.711 --> 01:11:39.296
We had a little accident.

01:11:39.546 --> 01:11:41.715
- That's all right.
- I'm sorry.

01:11:42.132 --> 01:11:43.133
Let me help you.

01:11:43.383 --> 01:11:45.051
It's all right, miss.

01:11:51.558 --> 01:11:52.976
It's all right, miss.

01:11:58.565 --> 01:11:59.899
Tea, Trudy.

01:12:17.417 --> 01:12:20.587
You're not to see that boy again.
You understand?

01:12:21.921 --> 01:12:24.257
Rose, I forbid it.

01:12:25.258 --> 01:12:28.261
Stop it, Mother.
You'll give yourself a nosebleed.

01:12:28.595 --> 01:12:30.263
This is not a game.

01:12:30.847 --> 01:12:34.434
Our situation is precarious.
You know the money's gone.

01:12:34.768 --> 01:12:39.105
Of course I know.
You remind me every day.

01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:45.028
Your father left us nothing but a legacy
of bad debts hidden by a good name.

01:12:45.278 --> 01:12:47.947
That name is the only card we have to play.

01:12:48.615 --> 01:12:50.283
I don't understand you.

01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:54.954
It is a fine match with Hockley.
It will ensure our survival.

01:12:56.289 --> 01:12:57.957
How can you put this on me?

01:12:58.208 --> 01:12:59.709
Why are you being so selfish?

01:13:00.210 --> 01:13:02.045
I'm being selfish?

01:13:05.548 --> 01:13:08.468
Do you want to see me
working as a seamstress?

01:13:10.303 --> 01:13:12.138
Is that what you want?

01:13:14.808 --> 01:13:17.644
To see our fine things sold at auction?

01:13:19.312 --> 01:13:21.147
Our memories scattered?

01:13:32.325 --> 01:13:33.993
It's so unfair.

01:13:35.328 --> 01:13:37.163
Of course it's unfair.

01:13:38.498 --> 01:13:39.833
We're women.

01:13:42.335 --> 01:13:44.504
Our choices are never easy.

01:14:06.359 --> 01:14:10.196
Protect them by Thy guiding hand

01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:15.368
From every peril on the land

01:14:17.370 --> 01:14:21.374
O, spirit whom the Father sent

01:14:22.041 --> 01:14:26.212
To spread abroad the firmament

01:14:26.546 --> 01:14:30.884
O, wind of heaven, by Thy might

01:14:31.217 --> 01:14:36.055
Save all who dare the eagle 's ï¬ight

01:14:36.389 --> 01:14:40.226
And keep them by Thy watchful care...

01:14:42.896 --> 01:14:44.564
Hello, Mr. Andrews.

01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:56.242
I need to talk to someone.

01:14:56.493 --> 01:14:58.745
You're not supposed to be in here.

01:15:03.416 --> 01:15:05.001
I was here last night, remember?

01:15:05.251 --> 01:15:06.920
No. Now please turn around.

01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:10.006
He'll tell you. I just need to talk--

01:15:10.256 --> 01:15:13.426
Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater...

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:16.596
...are still appreciative of your assistance.

01:15:16.930 --> 01:15:20.433
They asked me
to give you this in gratitude--

01:15:20.683 --> 01:15:22.268
I don't want your money.

01:15:22.602 --> 01:15:26.439
--And remind you you are
in third class and your presence here...

01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:28.441
...is no longer appropriate.

01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:30.026
Let me speak to Rose.

01:15:30.276 --> 01:15:34.280
Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawson
returns to where he belongs...

01:15:34.614 --> 01:15:36.282
...and that he stays there?

01:15:37.116 --> 01:15:38.117
Yes, sir.

01:15:38.368 --> 01:15:39.536
Come along, you.

01:15:41.621 --> 01:15:44.791
Hear us when we cry to Thee

01:15:45.124 --> 01:15:49.629
For those in peril on the sea

01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:52.465
Why are there two steering wheels?

01:15:52.715 --> 01:15:54.217
We use this one near shore.

01:15:54.467 --> 01:15:58.137
Excuse me, sir.
Another ice warning, from the Noordam.

01:15:58.388 --> 01:15:59.722
Thank you, Sparks.

01:16:01.975 --> 01:16:05.311
Not to worry.
Quite normal for this time of year.

01:16:06.312 --> 01:16:10.316
In fact, we're speeding up.
I've ordered the last boilers lit.

01:16:14.362 --> 01:16:17.323
Okay, son, wind it up tight
like I showed you. That's right.

01:16:17.532 --> 01:16:19.158
Okay, now let it go.

01:16:22.203 --> 01:16:24.205
- It was good, wasn't it?
- Quite nice. That's excellent.

01:16:31.212 --> 01:16:34.215
Mr. Andrews...Forgive me.

01:16:34.841 --> 01:16:36.259
I did the sum
in my head...

01:16:36.884 --> 01:16:40.388
...and with the number of lifeboats
times the capacity you mentioned...

01:16:40.722 --> 01:16:44.225
Forgive me, but it seems that there are
not enough for everyone aboard.

01:16:45.018 --> 01:16:46.728
About half, actually.

01:16:47.562 --> 01:16:49.063
Rose, you miss nothing,
do you?

01:16:49.897 --> 01:16:52.066
In fact, I put in these new
type davits...

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:55.028
...which can take an extra row
of boats inside this one.

01:16:55.737 --> 01:16:57.864
But it was thought,
by some...

01:16:57.864 --> 01:16:59.449
...the deck would look
too cluttered.

01:16:59.907 --> 01:17:02.243
So, I was overruled.

01:17:02.744 --> 01:17:05.747
It's a waste of deck space
as it is on an unsinkable ship.

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.874
Sleep soundly, young Rose.

01:17:07.874 --> 01:17:10.460
I have built you a good ship,
strong and true.

01:17:10.752 --> 01:17:12.420
She's all the lifeboat
you need.

01:17:12.754 --> 01:17:15.757
Just keep heading aft. The next
stop will be the engine room.

01:17:21.095 --> 01:17:25.433
Jack, this is impossible.
I can't see you.

01:17:25.725 --> 01:17:28.603
- I need to talk to you.
- No, Jack. No.

01:17:30.104 --> 01:17:32.440
Jack.
I'm engaged.

01:17:33.441 --> 01:17:35.276
I'm marrying Cal.

01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:37.236
I love Cal.

01:17:39.781 --> 01:17:41.115
Rose...

01:17:41.616 --> 01:17:46.120
...you're no picnic. All right?
You're a spoiled little brat even.

01:17:46.454 --> 01:17:50.958
But under that, you're the
most amazingly, astounding

01:17:51.292 --> 01:17:52.960
...wonderful girl...

01:17:53.586 --> 01:17:55.505
...woman, that I've ever known.

01:17:55.505 --> 01:17:56.631
Jack, I--

01:17:56.631 --> 01:17:59.342
No, let me try and get
this out. You're ama--

01:18:01.803 --> 01:18:04.806
I'm not an idiot.
I know how the world works.

01:18:05.139 --> 01:18:07.141
I've got ten bucks
in my pocket.

01:18:07.141 --> 01:18:09.936
I have nothing to offer
you and I know that.

01:18:10.144 --> 01:18:11.813
I understand.

01:18:12.772 --> 01:18:14.440
But I'm too involved now.

01:18:14.816 --> 01:18:16.818
You jump, I jump
Remember?

01:18:17.151 --> 01:18:19.654
I can't turn away without
knowing you'll be all right.

01:18:21.447 --> 01:18:22.448
That's all that I want.

01:18:23.825 --> 01:18:25.326
Well, I'm fine.

01:18:26.494 --> 01:18:28.996
I'll be fine. Really.

01:18:29.997 --> 01:18:31.165
Really?

01:18:33.334 --> 01:18:34.836
I don't think so.

01:18:35.837 --> 01:18:38.131
They've got you trapped, Rose.

01:18:38.131 --> 01:18:39.632
And you're gonna die if you
don't break free.

01:18:39.632 --> 01:18:40.800
Maybe not right away...

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:42.468
...because you're strong...

01:18:43.845 --> 01:18:47.181
...but sooner or later that
fire that I love about you, Rose...

01:18:47.515 --> 01:18:50.017
...that fire is gonna
burn out.

01:18:54.856 --> 01:18:56.649
It's not up to you
to save me, Jack.

01:18:59.152 --> 01:19:00.361
You're right.

01:19:01.696 --> 01:19:03.364
Only you can do that.

01:19:09.370 --> 01:19:10.872
I'm going back.

01:19:11.205 --> 01:19:12.707
Leave me alone.

01:19:24.218 --> 01:19:27.388
Tell Lucile about the disaster
you had with the stationers.

01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:30.349
Well, of course the invitations
had to be sent back, twice.

01:19:30.558 --> 01:19:31.726
Oh, my dear.

01:19:32.018 --> 01:19:33.686
And the dreadful
bridesmaids' gowns.

01:19:33.686 --> 01:19:36.022
Let me tell you what an
odyssey that has been.

01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:38.524
Rose decided she
wanted lavender.

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:40.443
She knows I detest the color.

01:19:40.902 --> 01:19:42.195
So, she did it only to spite me.

01:19:42.403 --> 01:19:44.405
If only you'd come to
me sooner.

01:19:44.697 --> 01:19:47.533
Ruth saw some of my designs in
La Mode IllustrÃ©e.

01:19:47.742 --> 01:19:51.204
They were for the trousseau of the Duchess
of Marlborough's youngest daughter.

01:19:51.204 --> 01:19:52.288
They were quite charming.

01:19:52.288 --> 01:19:54.290
But, I think you'll agree,
my dear, that together...

01:19:54.582 --> 01:19:57.752
...we've created something
of a phoenix from the ashes.

01:20:12.558 --> 01:20:13.559
Hello, Jack.

01:20:19.273 --> 01:20:21.108
I changed my mind.

01:20:27.073 --> 01:20:28.282
They said you might be up here.

01:20:31.285 --> 01:20:32.620
Give me your hand.

01:20:40.127 --> 01:20:41.462
Now close your eyes.

01:20:42.797 --> 01:20:44.131
Go on.

01:20:47.468 --> 01:20:48.970
Now, step up.

01:20:52.807 --> 01:20:54.183
Now, hold onto the railing.

01:20:54.183 --> 01:20:56.185
Keep your eyes closed.
Don't peek.

01:20:56.435 --> 01:20:57.436
I'm not.

01:20:58.813 --> 01:21:00.815
Now, step up onto the rail.

01:21:04.819 --> 01:21:06.821
Hold on. Hold on.

01:21:07.321 --> 01:21:09.156
Keep your eyes closed.

01:21:09.657 --> 01:21:10.992
Do you trust me?

01:21:11.492 --> 01:21:12.827
I trust you.

01:21:22.670 --> 01:21:23.671
All right...

01:21:24.046 --> 01:21:25.548
---Open your eyes.

01:21:32.638 --> 01:21:33.639
I'm flying.

01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:35.141
Jack.

01:22:00.249 --> 01:22:04.378
Come, Josephine, in my
ï¬ying machine. Going up...

01:22:05.212 --> 01:22:08.549
...she goes. Up she goes.

01:22:56.263 --> 01:22:59.266
That was the last time
Titanic ever saw daylight.

01:23:00.726 --> 01:23:02.812
We're up to dusk the
night of the sinking.

01:23:03.646 --> 01:23:04.897
6 hours to go.

01:23:05.106 --> 01:23:08.150
Incredible. There's Smith and
he's standing there and...

01:23:08.150 --> 01:23:09.819
...he's got the iceberg warning
in his fucking hand...

01:23:10.069 --> 01:23:13.072
...excuse me--his hand,
and he's ordering more speed.

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:16.450
26 years of experience
working against him.

01:23:16.742 --> 01:23:18.911
He figures anything big
enough to sink, the ship...

01:23:18.911 --> 01:23:20.663
...they're gonna see in time to turn.

01:23:20.955 --> 01:23:23.582
But the ship's too big
with too small a rudder.

01:23:23.582 --> 01:23:25.626
Doesn't corner worth a damn.

01:23:26.794 --> 01:23:29.130
Everything he knows
is wrong.

01:23:41.809 --> 01:23:45.646
It's quite proper, I assure you.
This is the sitting room.

01:23:47.648 --> 01:23:49.150
- Will this light do?
- What?

01:23:50.484 --> 01:23:51.819
Don't artists need good light?

01:23:52.111 --> 01:23:54.321
That is true, but I'm not
used to working in...

01:23:55.114 --> 01:23:56.699
...such horrible conditions.

01:23:57.491 --> 01:23:58.826
Monet!

01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:02.329
- Do you know his work?
- Of course.

01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:04.665
Look at his use of color here.
Isn't he great?

01:24:04.957 --> 01:24:06.959
I know. It's extraordinary.

01:24:09.462 --> 01:24:12.798
Cal insists on carting
this hideous thing everywhere.

01:24:13.466 --> 01:24:16.135
Should we be expecting him
any time soon?

01:24:16.635 --> 01:24:19.972
Not as long as the cigars
and brandy hold out.

01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:24.351
That's nice.

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:26.395
What is it,
a sapphire?

01:24:27.188 --> 01:24:28.314
A diamond.

01:24:28.981 --> 01:24:30.399
A very rare diamond.

01:24:34.195 --> 01:24:36.822
Jack, I want you to draw me
like one of your French girls.

01:24:38.199 --> 01:24:39.533
Wearing this.

01:24:39.867 --> 01:24:41.035
All right.

01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:44.872
Wearing only this.

01:25:20.282 --> 01:25:24.078
The last thing I need is another picture of me
looking like a porcelain doll.

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.041
As a paying customer...

01:25:32.044 --> 01:25:33.921
...I expect to get
what I want.

01:25:51.772 --> 01:25:54.567
Over on the bed
...uh, the couch.

01:26:03.742 --> 01:26:04.743
Come. Lie down.

01:26:08.247 --> 01:26:09.748
- Tell me when it looks right.
- Keep that.

01:26:09.957 --> 01:26:11.792
Put your arm back
the way it was.

01:26:14.461 --> 01:26:17.631
Put that other arm up,
that hand right by your face there.

01:26:19.133 --> 01:26:20.134
Right.

01:26:21.135 --> 01:26:23.304
Now, head down.

01:26:25.931 --> 01:26:27.808
Eyes to me.
Keep them on me.

01:26:29.810 --> 01:26:31.979
And try to stay still.

01:26:50.497 --> 01:26:52.499
So serious.

01:27:33.874 --> 01:27:36.877
I believe you are blushing,
Mr. Big Artiste.

01:27:41.382 --> 01:27:44.218
I can't imagine
Monsieur Monet blushing.

01:27:45.552 --> 01:27:47.221
He does landscapes.

01:27:47.888 --> 01:27:50.057
- Just relax your face.
- Sorry.

01:27:50.391 --> 01:27:51.725
No laughing.

01:28:22.756 --> 01:28:25.759
My heart was pounding
the whole time.

01:28:26.093 --> 01:28:30.097
It was the most erotic
moment of my life...

01:28:33.767 --> 01:28:36.103
...up until then, at least.

01:28:36.603 --> 01:28:38.397
So what happened next?

01:28:39.273 --> 01:28:41.942
You mean,
did we do it?

01:28:44.445 --> 01:28:46.780
Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine.

01:28:47.281 --> 01:28:49.783
Jack was very professional.

01:28:57.791 --> 01:28:58.959
Thank you.

01:29:07.092 --> 01:29:08.427
What are you doing?

01:29:09.303 --> 01:29:11.597
Will you put this
back in the safe for me?

01:29:23.650 --> 01:29:25.486
Gentlemen, would you excuse me.

01:29:27.821 --> 01:29:29.823
None of the stewards
have seen her.

01:29:30.824 --> 01:29:33.702
This is absurd.
It's a ship.

01:29:33.702 --> 01:29:35.871
There's only so many
places she could be.

01:29:36.163 --> 01:29:37.831
Lovejoy, find her.

01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:56.475
- Clear.
- Yes.

01:29:58.185 --> 01:30:01.688
I don't think I've ever
seen such a flat calm.

01:30:02.189 --> 01:30:03.190
Like a mill pond.

01:30:04.358 --> 01:30:05.901
Not a breath of wind.

01:30:07.027 --> 01:30:10.030
It will make the bergs
harder to see---

01:30:10.364 --> 01:30:12.324
...with no breaking
water at the base.

01:30:23.836 --> 01:30:24.920
Well, I'm off.

01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:28.090
Maintain speed and
heading, Mr. Lightoller.

01:30:28.841 --> 01:30:30.092
Yes, sir.

01:30:41.395 --> 01:30:43.730
It's getting cold.
You look nice.

01:30:44.064 --> 01:30:45.399
Miss Rose?

01:30:45.899 --> 01:30:47.568
My drawings!

01:31:13.594 --> 01:31:14.887
Come on!

01:31:17.931 --> 01:31:19.266
Wait, wait, wait!

01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:20.934
Wait, wait, wait!

01:31:21.894 --> 01:31:23.437
- Go. Go. Down, down.
- Take us down, quickly. Quickly!

01:31:31.069 --> 01:31:32.070
Bye.

01:31:39.953 --> 01:31:41.288
Sorry.

01:31:46.627 --> 01:31:48.295
- Keep going.
- Thank you, I've got it.

01:31:58.597 --> 01:32:00.516
Pretty tough for
a valet, this fella.

01:32:00.516 --> 01:32:02.267
Seems more like a cop.

01:32:02.476 --> 01:32:03.602
I think he was.

01:32:04.311 --> 01:32:05.938
- Oh, shit.
- Go!

01:32:10.817 --> 01:32:12.319
No, over here!

01:32:12.653 --> 01:32:13.820
Quick!

01:32:20.327 --> 01:32:21.995
Now what?

01:32:22.287 --> 01:32:23.622
Wh at?

01:32:28.835 --> 01:32:30.504
More coal for number
one, mate.

01:32:30.796 --> 01:32:33.298
Hold up? What are you two
doing down here?

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:34.841
You shouldn't be down here.

01:32:35.175 --> 01:32:36.218
It could be dangerous!

01:32:40.639 --> 01:32:41.640
Carry on!

01:32:42.015 --> 01:32:44.059
Don't mind us. You're
doing a great job!

01:32:44.059 --> 01:32:45.561
Keep up the good work!

01:33:01.868 --> 01:33:03.870
Look at what we have here, huh?

01:33:22.055 --> 01:33:23.390
Thank you.

01:33:35.068 --> 01:33:36.903
Where to, miss?

01:33:38.071 --> 01:33:39.740
To the stars.

01:33:58.759 --> 01:34:00.260
You nervous?

01:34:02.721 --> 01:34:03.889
No.

01:34:20.781 --> 01:34:22.783
Put your hands on me, Jack.

01:34:46.807 --> 01:34:48.308
It's bloody cold.

01:34:48.809 --> 01:34:52.312
You know, I can smell ice, you know.
When it's near.

01:34:53.647 --> 01:34:54.981
Bollocks!

01:34:55.315 --> 01:34:56.983
Well, I can, all right?

01:34:57.317 --> 01:34:59.444
Did you ever find those
binoculars for the lookouts?

01:34:59.653 --> 01:35:01.488
Haven't seen them
since Southampton.

01:35:02.155 --> 01:35:03.490
Well, I'll be on
my rounds.

01:35:04.449 --> 01:35:05.450
Cheerio.

01:35:36.690 --> 01:35:38.024
You're trembling.

01:35:40.485 --> 01:35:41.653
Don't worry.

01:35:41.653 --> 01:35:43.405
I'll be all right.

01:36:04.718 --> 01:36:06.553
- They ran down there.
- Right.

01:36:16.313 --> 01:36:17.981
Anything missing?

01:36:43.006 --> 01:36:44.841
I have a better idea.

01:36:57.687 --> 01:36:58.855
GOI you!

01:37:08.114 --> 01:37:10.951
Did you see those guys' faces?

01:37:11.535 --> 01:37:13.370
Did you see them?

01:37:19.709 --> 01:37:21.545
When the ship docks...

01:37:22.879 --> 01:37:24.631
...I'm getting off with you.

01:37:25.715 --> 01:37:27.217
This is crazy.

01:37:27.217 --> 01:37:30.053
I know. It doesn't make any sense.

01:37:31.555 --> 01:37:33.056
That's why I trust it.

01:37:42.065 --> 01:37:44.734
Here, look at this.

01:37:45.569 --> 01:37:47.571
Look at that, would you?

01:37:47.904 --> 01:37:49.406
They're warmer than we are.

01:37:49.823 --> 01:37:54.160
If that's what it takes for us to get warm,
I'd rather not.

01:38:06.423 --> 01:38:07.924
Bugger me!

01:38:13.263 --> 01:38:14.764
Pick up, you bastards!

01:38:18.435 --> 01:38:19.436
Is anyone there?!

01:38:19.686 --> 01:38:20.854
What do you see?

01:38:21.104 --> 01:38:22.522
Iceberg, right ahead!

01:38:22.772 --> 01:38:23.857
Thank you.

01:38:26.192 --> 01:38:27.360
Iceberg ahead!

01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.362
Hard a' starboard!

01:38:36.286 --> 01:38:38.538
Turn! Turn! Srnartly!

01:38:43.793 --> 01:38:44.794
Full astern!

01:38:47.130 --> 01:38:48.298
Hard over.

01:38:48.298 --> 01:38:49.966
Helm's hard over, sir.

01:38:53.637 --> 01:38:55.138
Go, lads, go!

01:38:57.557 --> 01:39:00.310
Bring that steam down! Bring it down!

01:39:02.145 --> 01:39:04.981
Shut all the dampers! Shut them!

01:39:09.819 --> 01:39:10.820
Hold it.

01:39:12.656 --> 01:39:13.657
Hold it!

01:39:15.075 --> 01:39:16.826
Now! Engage reversing engine!

01:39:45.855 --> 01:39:47.357
Why ain't they turning?

01:39:47.607 --> 01:39:48.775
Is it hard over?!

01:39:49.025 --> 01:39:51.027
It is, sir. Hard over.

01:39:55.031 --> 01:39:59.202
Come on, come on, come on. Turn.

01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:11.715
Yes.

01:40:16.886 --> 01:40:18.555
It's going to hit!

01:40:29.983 --> 01:40:31.484
Jesus Christ!

01:40:52.255 --> 01:40:53.423
Jesus!

01:40:53.673 --> 01:40:54.674
Hard to port!

01:40:54.924 --> 01:40:56.259
Hard to port!

01:41:06.102 --> 01:41:07.604
Get back!

01:41:37.050 --> 01:41:38.384
Let's go!

01:41:38.635 --> 01:41:41.971
They're closing the doors! Get out!

01:41:48.478 --> 01:41:50.814
Get out the door! Go!

01:41:51.147 --> 01:41:54.150
Go! Come on, lads! Go, lads, go!

01:42:03.827 --> 01:42:05.495
Go! Go!

01:42:05.995 --> 01:42:07.997
Out! Out!

01:42:22.679 --> 01:42:24.347
Oh, my God.

01:42:25.181 --> 01:42:26.516
That was a close shave.

01:42:26.850 --> 01:42:29.769
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!

01:42:33.857 --> 01:42:36.693
Note the time. Enter it in the log.

01:42:42.448 --> 01:42:44.117
What was that, Mr. Murdoch?

01:42:45.034 --> 01:42:46.452
An iceberg, sir.

01:42:47.537 --> 01:42:51.040
I put her hard to starboard, but it was too close.

01:42:51.374 --> 01:42:53.543
I tried to port round it, but--

01:42:53.877 --> 01:42:57.046
- Close the watertight doors.
- They're closed, sir.

01:43:00.216 --> 01:43:01.384
All stop.

01:43:10.727 --> 01:43:12.896
Have the carpenter sound the ship.

01:43:24.574 --> 01:43:27.911
Come on, let's get the hell out of here!

01:43:32.749 --> 01:43:35.585
Why have the engines stopped? I felt a shudder.

01:43:35.835 --> 01:43:38.504
Not to worry. We threw a propeller blade.

01:43:38.755 --> 01:43:41.591
That's the shudder you felt.
Do you need anything?

01:43:42.425 --> 01:43:43.509
No, thank you.

01:43:48.431 --> 01:43:50.934
There's talk of an iceberg.

01:43:51.184 --> 01:43:52.936
I don't see anything. Do you?

01:43:55.104 --> 01:43:58.274
If this is where the rats are going, I am, too.

01:44:05.281 --> 01:44:06.950
- You.
- There is no emergency.

01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:10.036
- There is. I've been robbed.
- Get the Master at Arms.

01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:12.288
Now, you moron!

01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:18.294
Did I miss the fun?

01:44:19.462 --> 01:44:23.132
- Did you see what happened?
- No- I guess it hit over there-

01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:28.554
Boiler room six is flooded eight feet
and the mail hold is worse.

01:44:28.805 --> 01:44:31.224
- Can you shore up?
- Not unless the pumps get ahead.

01:44:31.474 --> 01:44:34.644
- Have you seen the mail hold?
- It's already underwater.

01:44:35.228 --> 01:44:36.896
This is bad.

01:44:39.232 --> 01:44:40.817
We should tell Mother and Cal.

01:44:41.901 --> 01:44:43.987
I think they're very good, sir.

01:44:46.823 --> 01:44:49.826
Don't touch anything.
I want the room photographed.

01:44:54.831 --> 01:44:57.000
We've been looking for you, miss.

01:45:01.838 --> 01:45:02.922
Here we go.

01:45:08.845 --> 01:45:10.263
Something serious has happened.

01:45:11.848 --> 01:45:13.349
Yes, it has.

01:45:14.851 --> 01:45:18.271
Indeed.
Two things dear to me have disappeared.

01:45:18.521 --> 01:45:22.692
Now that one is back,
I know where to find the other. Search him.

01:45:22.942 --> 01:45:24.777
- Take your coat off.
- Now what?

01:45:25.945 --> 01:45:29.949
What are you doing?
We're in the middle of an emergency.

01:45:30.199 --> 01:45:32.285
- Is this it?
- That's it.

01:45:32.869 --> 01:45:34.704
This is horseshit!

01:45:36.039 --> 01:45:37.373
Don't you believe it.

01:45:37.707 --> 01:45:41.044
- He couldn't have.
- Easy enough for a professional.

01:45:41.294 --> 01:45:43.796
I was with him the entire time.

01:45:44.047 --> 01:45:47.050
Perhaps he did it while you were putting
your clothes back on, dear.

01:45:48.718 --> 01:45:50.970
Real slick. They put it in my pocket.

01:45:51.220 --> 01:45:54.057
- Shut up.
- It isn't even your pocket.

01:45:54.307 --> 01:45:55.808
"Property of A.L. Ryerson."

01:46:00.146 --> 01:46:01.647
That was reported stolen.

01:46:01.898 --> 01:46:03.483
I just borrowed it.

01:46:03.733 --> 01:46:06.069
Oh, we have an honest thief.

01:46:06.402 --> 01:46:08.571
You know I didn't do this, Rose.

01:46:09.405 --> 01:46:11.407
Don't believe them. You know it.

01:46:11.657 --> 01:46:12.658
Let's go, son.

01:46:12.909 --> 01:46:14.744
You know I didn't do it!

01:46:15.078 --> 01:46:18.081
There's a good lad. Come on.

01:46:18.414 --> 01:46:20.750
You know I didn't do it! You know me!

01:46:22.668 --> 01:46:24.921
This is most unfortunate, Captain.

01:46:28.424 --> 01:46:31.844
Water fourteen feet above the keel
in ten minutes...

01:46:32.095 --> 01:46:35.431
...in the forepeak,
all three holds and boiler room six.

01:46:35.681 --> 01:46:36.682
That's right.

01:46:36.933 --> 01:46:38.267
When can we get underway?

01:46:38.518 --> 01:46:40.520
That's five compartments.

01:46:42.438 --> 01:46:46.442
She can float with four compartments breached,
but not five.

01:46:47.110 --> 01:46:50.780
Not five. As she goes down,
the water will spill...

01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:55.201
...over the tops of the bulkheads at E deck,
one to the next...

01:46:55.451 --> 01:46:58.121
...back and back. There's no stopping it.

01:46:58.454 --> 01:46:59.705
The pumps.

01:46:59.956 --> 01:47:03.126
The pumps buy you time, but minutes only.

01:47:03.793 --> 01:47:06.045
As of now, no matter what we do...

01:47:06.963 --> 01:47:09.132
...Titanic will founder.

01:47:11.467 --> 01:47:12.802
But this ship can't sink.

01:47:13.052 --> 01:47:15.888
She's made of iron. I assure you, she can.

01:47:16.472 --> 01:47:17.473
And she will.

01:47:18.307 --> 01:47:20.393
It's a mathematical certainty.

01:47:24.814 --> 01:47:26.315
How much time?

01:47:33.823 --> 01:47:36.325
An hour. Two, at most.

01:47:42.331 --> 01:47:44.417
How many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?

01:47:44.834 --> 01:47:47.670
Two thousand, two hundred souls, sir.

01:47:54.343 --> 01:47:57.847
Well, I believe you may get your headlines,
Mr. lsmay.

01:48:15.364 --> 01:48:17.533
Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?

01:48:18.367 --> 01:48:20.536
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

01:48:20.786 --> 01:48:22.955
- Mr. Hockley?
- Not now. We're busy.

01:48:23.206 --> 01:48:26.626
You've been asked to put on lifebelts
and go to the boat deck.

01:48:26.876 --> 01:48:27.877
I said, not now.

01:48:28.127 --> 01:48:33.132
I'm sorry, Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders.
Dress warmly.

01:48:33.382 --> 01:48:35.551
It's quite cold out.

01:48:35.885 --> 01:48:38.721
May I suggest topcoats and hats?

01:48:39.055 --> 01:48:40.890
This is ridiculous.

01:48:41.557 --> 01:48:45.228
Not to worry, miss.
I'm sure it's just a precaution.

01:48:45.561 --> 01:48:47.563
Everybody up! Lifebelts on!

01:48:49.232 --> 01:48:50.816
What's he on about?

01:48:51.734 --> 01:48:53.569
- Put your lifebelts on!
- What is it?

01:48:53.819 --> 01:48:55.154
Just put them on.

01:48:56.405 --> 01:48:57.573
C.O.D.?

01:48:58.241 --> 01:48:59.408
Sir?

01:49:01.077 --> 01:49:04.914
That's right, C.O.D. The distress call.
That's our position.

01:49:10.503 --> 01:49:14.757
Tell whoever responds we're going down
and need immediate assistance.

01:49:24.267 --> 01:49:25.601
Blimey.

01:49:35.778 --> 01:49:37.613
Keep lowering!

01:49:37.947 --> 01:49:39.949
Keep lowering!

01:49:43.786 --> 01:49:47.623
Steady! Make it taut! And winch out!

01:49:51.460 --> 01:49:55.464
Uncover this boat! Uncover all the boats aft!

01:49:55.798 --> 01:49:57.466
Release those ties!

01:49:57.800 --> 01:50:00.553
Roll back that cover! Smartly now!

01:50:01.137 --> 01:50:02.638
Where are the passengers?

01:50:02.888 --> 01:50:06.225
They went inside- Too cold and noisy for them

01:50:06.475 --> 01:50:10.813
You there! Get down here
and help with these lines!

01:50:24.994 --> 01:50:26.829
Care for a drink, sir?

01:50:29.332 --> 01:50:34.253
Sonny, what's doing? You get us all trussed up
and now we're cooling our heels.

01:50:34.503 --> 01:50:37.006
Sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out.

01:50:37.673 --> 01:50:40.009
Nobody knows what's going on.

01:50:40.259 --> 01:50:43.179
Just like the damn English--everything by the book.

01:50:43.429 --> 01:50:46.349
No need for language, Mr. Hockley.

01:50:46.349 --> 01:50:51.187
Go back and turn on the heaters in our rooms.
I want a cup of tea when I return.

01:51:02.031 --> 01:51:03.032
Mr. Andrews.

01:51:05.034 --> 01:51:08.371
I saw the iceberg. And I see it in your eyes.

01:51:08.704 --> 01:51:10.373
Please tell me the truth.

01:51:18.547 --> 01:51:20.383
The ship will sink.

01:51:22.134 --> 01:51:23.135
You're certain?

01:51:24.220 --> 01:51:29.058
In an hour or so, all this
will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.

01:51:31.727 --> 01:51:36.065
Please, tell only who you must.
I don't want to cause a panic.

01:51:36.399 --> 01:51:39.235
And get to a boat. Quickly. Don't wait.

01:51:39.902 --> 01:51:43.072
You remember what I told you about the boats?

01:51:45.408 --> 01:51:46.742
Yes.

01:51:48.577 --> 01:51:50.079
I understand.

01:51:58.087 --> 01:51:59.422
Over here, son.

01:52:00.423 --> 01:52:03.592
Sir, there's a big mob
at the Second Class Purser's office.

01:52:03.926 --> 01:52:05.678
Go on. I'll watch him.

01:52:06.429 --> 01:52:08.431
Aye. Right.

01:52:22.111 --> 01:52:27.116
Sir, Carpathia says they're making 17 knots.
Full steam for them, sir.

01:52:28.951 --> 01:52:30.369
She's the only one responding?

01:52:30.619 --> 01:52:34.206
The only one close. They'll be here in four hours.

01:52:34.957 --> 01:52:36.625
Four hours?!

01:52:41.630 --> 01:52:43.132
Thank you, Bride.

01:52:47.470 --> 01:52:49.138
My God.

01:52:58.647 --> 01:53:00.649
We are swung out and ready, sir.

01:53:02.151 --> 01:53:06.071
Hadn't we better get the women and children
into the boats?

01:53:07.990 --> 01:53:08.991
Yes.

01:53:13.162 --> 01:53:16.332
Women and children first, yes.

01:53:17.833 --> 01:53:19.168
Yes, sir.

01:53:22.004 --> 01:53:24.673
Ladies and gentlemen, attention, please!

01:53:25.174 --> 01:53:27.676
Step this way, please. That's right.

01:53:28.010 --> 01:53:30.846
Come towards me. Thank you.

01:53:31.847 --> 01:53:32.848
Good.

01:53:33.098 --> 01:53:37.353
For the time being,
I require only women and children

01:53:37.853 --> 01:53:39.021
Right here.

01:53:39.688 --> 01:53:43.692
Like the Captain said,
nice and cheery, so there's no panic.

01:53:44.693 --> 01:53:46.028
"Wedding Dance."

01:53:54.411 --> 01:53:57.039
Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on.

01:53:57.373 --> 01:54:00.042
Put your lifebelts on. Lifebelt on.

01:54:00.376 --> 01:54:03.379
Here, put that lifebelt on. Turn it around.

01:54:08.717 --> 01:54:11.053
It isn't time to go to the boats yet!

01:54:11.387 --> 01:54:13.055
Please, stay calm.

01:54:13.389 --> 01:54:16.559
Make sure you have your lifebelts on.

01:54:16.892 --> 01:54:19.311
Let women and children through to the front.

01:54:19.562 --> 01:54:20.896
What are we doing?

01:54:21.146 --> 01:54:24.233
Waiting. Once first-class people
are in the boats...

01:54:24.483 --> 01:54:27.820
...they'll start with us and we want to be ready.

01:54:28.988 --> 01:54:31.240
Pushing won't get you out any faster.

01:54:31.574 --> 01:54:32.908
Go get help.

01:54:33.242 --> 01:54:37.246
Lower it away, left and right together! Steady.

01:54:37.913 --> 01:54:40.916
Both sides together! Steady!

01:54:41.250 --> 01:54:42.418
Steady!

01:54:42.751 --> 01:54:44.086
Steady!

01:54:45.588 --> 01:54:47.590
Stop, stop, stop!

01:54:48.424 --> 01:54:49.592
Hold the left!

01:54:49.925 --> 01:54:52.428
Right side only! Right side only!

01:54:52.761 --> 01:54:53.929
Right side!

01:54:54.263 --> 01:54:58.100
Hold the left! Right side down!
Lower away together!

01:55:00.269 --> 01:55:01.937
Steady, lads!

01:55:49.318 --> 01:55:52.821
You know, I do believe this ship may sink.

01:55:54.823 --> 01:55:59.495
I've been asked to give you
this small token of our appreciation.

01:56:01.997 --> 01:56:04.667
Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.

01:56:11.423 --> 01:56:14.093
Come on, sister, you heard
the man. Into the boat.

01:56:14.426 --> 01:56:16.553
Any room for a gentleman,
gentlemen?

01:56:16.762 --> 01:56:18.097
Only women at this time, sir.

01:56:21.433 --> 01:56:23.811
Will the lifeboats be
seated according to class?

01:56:25.729 --> 01:56:28.440
I hope they're not too crowded.

01:56:29.233 --> 01:56:31.068
Oh, Mother, shut up!

01:56:31.944 --> 01:56:33.112
Don't you understand?

01:56:33.612 --> 01:56:35.322
The water is freezing and
there aren't enough boats.

01:56:35.614 --> 01:56:37.241
Not enough by half.

01:56:38.117 --> 01:56:40.619
Half the people on this
ship are going to die.

01:56:40.953 --> 01:56:42.579
Not the better half.

01:56:44.456 --> 01:56:45.499
Come on, Ruth,
get in the boat.

01:56:46.083 --> 01:56:47.960
First class seats
are right up here.

01:56:49.128 --> 01:56:51.088
You know, it's a pity I didn't
keep that drawing.

01:56:51.088 --> 01:56:52.673
It'll be worth a lot
more by morning.

01:56:56.635 --> 01:56:59.304
You unimaginable bastard.

01:57:00.097 --> 01:57:02.099
Come on, Rose darling.
There's plenty of room for you.

01:57:03.976 --> 01:57:05.019
Come on, Rose.

01:57:05.519 --> 01:57:07.146
You're next, darling.

01:57:07.479 --> 01:57:08.647
Come into the boat, Rose.

01:57:11.108 --> 01:57:12.109
Come.

01:57:12.443 --> 01:57:13.485
Rose.

01:57:14.319 --> 01:57:15.612
Get into the boat!

01:57:17.114 --> 01:57:18.115
Rose.

01:57:19.283 --> 01:57:20.451
Good-bye, Mother.

01:57:24.621 --> 01:57:26.123
Where are you going?

01:57:26.832 --> 01:57:27.833
To him?!

01:57:28.792 --> 01:57:30.294
To be a whore
to a gutter rat?

01:57:31.503 --> 01:57:33.839
I'd rather be his whore
than your wife.

01:57:36.216 --> 01:57:38.343
No!

01:57:39.053 --> 01:57:41.055
I said, no!

01:57:42.347 --> 01:57:44.683
Rose!
Please, stop!

01:57:45.976 --> 01:57:47.311
And, lower away!

01:57:48.645 --> 01:57:49.730
No, Wait!

01:57:49.730 --> 01:57:50.814
Lower away!

01:57:50.814 --> 01:57:52.691
- Rose!
- Lower together!

01:57:53.358 --> 01:57:54.735
Hold the left side!

01:57:58.655 --> 01:57:59.656
Help!

01:58:00.532 --> 01:58:02.659
Can anybody hear me?!

01:58:04.036 --> 01:58:05.704
Hello! Help me!

01:58:06.538 --> 01:58:07.539
Help me!

01:58:08.373 --> 01:58:10.375
Can you hear me?!

01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:14.713
Can anybody hear me?!
Somebody help me!

01:58:15.881 --> 01:58:17.382
Mr. Andrews?!

01:58:21.053 --> 01:58:23.222
Steward, check the
starboard corridor.

01:58:23.514 --> 01:58:26.016
Madame, please put on a lifebelt.
Get to the boat deck immediately.

01:58:26.558 --> 01:58:29.269
Lucy, for God's sake put on your
lifebelt and set a good example.

01:58:29.269 --> 01:58:30.270
Yes sir.

01:58:30.896 --> 01:58:32.231
- Anyone in here?
- Mr. Andrews!

01:58:32.564 --> 01:58:34.399
Mr. Andrews!
Thank God!

01:58:34.691 --> 01:58:37.027
Where would the Master at Arms
take someone under arrest?

01:58:37.611 --> 01:58:39.029
What? You have to get
to a boat right away.

01:58:39.029 --> 01:58:40.072
No!

01:58:40.072 --> 01:58:42.366
I'm doing this with or
without your help, sir.

01:58:42.908 --> 01:58:43.909
But without will take longer.

01:58:46.870 --> 01:58:49.206
Take the elevator to the
very bottom. Go to the left...

01:58:49.206 --> 01:58:50.415
...down the crewmen's passage.

01:58:50.415 --> 01:58:53.293
Then go right and left
again at the stairs.

01:58:53.293 --> 01:58:54.545
You'll come
to a long corridor.

01:58:59.424 --> 01:59:01.093
This could be bad.

01:59:04.930 --> 01:59:07.599
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!

01:59:12.938 --> 01:59:14.940
Excuse me. Thank you.

01:59:18.443 --> 01:59:21.446
I'm sorry, miss,
but the lifts are closed.

01:59:22.281 --> 01:59:25.242
I'm through being polite,
goddamnit!

01:59:25.242 --> 01:59:26.326
Now take me down!

01:59:27.619 --> 01:59:28.954
E deck.

01:59:32.291 --> 01:59:33.625
Come on.

01:59:34.084 --> 01:59:35.419
Come on, come on.

01:59:53.270 --> 01:59:54.646
I'm going back up.

01:59:54.646 --> 01:59:56.815
No! No! No!

02:00:00.986 --> 02:00:02.821
Come back!
I'm going back up!

02:00:03.155 --> 02:00:04.156
I'm going back up!

02:00:13.165 --> 02:00:14.166
Crew passage.

02:00:37.522 --> 02:00:38.523
Jack!

02:00:51.328 --> 02:00:52.329
Rose!

02:00:54.748 --> 02:00:56.166
Rose, I'm in here!

02:00:56.750 --> 02:00:58.085
I'm in here!

02:00:58.627 --> 02:00:59.711
I'm in here!

02:01:01.922 --> 02:01:03.924
Jack! I'm sorry.

02:01:04.258 --> 02:01:06.593
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

02:01:07.594 --> 02:01:09.012
That guy Lovejoy put
it in my pocket.

02:01:09.012 --> 02:01:11.014
I know, I know, I know.

02:01:11.014 --> 02:01:12.182
Listen Rose...

02:01:12.182 --> 02:01:14.685
...you're gonna have to find
the spare key, all right?

02:01:14.685 --> 02:01:16.019
Look in that
cabinet right there.

02:01:17.562 --> 02:01:19.481
It's a little silver one, Rose.

02:01:22.067 --> 02:01:23.568
These are all
brass ones!

02:01:24.444 --> 02:01:25.946
Check right here, Rose.

02:01:30.534 --> 02:01:31.535
Rose.

02:01:32.869 --> 02:01:34.454
How did you find out I didn't do it?

02:01:34.913 --> 02:01:36.039
I didn't.

02:01:36.039 --> 02:01:38.041
I just realized
I already knew.

02:01:40.627 --> 02:01:41.628
Keep looking.

02:01:50.971 --> 02:01:52.014
No key.

02:01:52.556 --> 02:01:53.640
There's no key!

02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:54.641
All right, Rose, listen.

02:01:54.975 --> 02:01:56.351
You're gonna have
to go find some help.

02:01:57.227 --> 02:01:58.228
It'll be all right.

02:02:03.650 --> 02:02:05.068
I'll be right back.

02:02:12.659 --> 02:02:14.494
I'll just wait here!

02:02:27.799 --> 02:02:29.009
Hello?
ls there anyone here?

02:02:30.218 --> 02:02:31.219
Hello?

02:02:31.845 --> 02:02:33.472
Is there anybody
down here?

02:02:34.681 --> 02:02:36.475
We need help! Hello?

02:02:38.185 --> 02:02:39.186
Damnit!

02:02:45.692 --> 02:02:49.529
Can anybody hear me, please?!
Hello?! Hello?!

02:02:51.531 --> 02:02:52.866
Oh, thank God.

02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:54.326
Wait, please, I need your help.

02:02:54.618 --> 02:02:55.619
There's a man back
here and he's--

02:02:56.495 --> 02:02:57.496
Wait!

02:03:01.708 --> 02:03:03.043
Hello?!

02:03:28.819 --> 02:03:29.861
Hello?

02:03:31.321 --> 02:03:32.823
Miss, you shouldn't
be here now.

02:03:33.115 --> 02:03:34.324
I need your help.

02:03:34.699 --> 02:03:36.451
There is a man down
here and he is trapped.

02:03:36.660 --> 02:03:37.661
- This way, yes. All right.
- Please!

02:03:37.994 --> 02:03:39.830
- There's no need to panic.
- No, I'm not panicking!

02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:41.915
You're going the
wrong way!

02:03:42.249 --> 02:03:44.000
Let go of me!
Listen!!!

02:03:49.673 --> 02:03:50.674
To hell with you.

02:04:28.628 --> 02:04:30.130
Oh, my God.

02:05:22.182 --> 02:05:23.767
Will this work?

02:05:24.684 --> 02:05:25.769
I guess we'll
find out.

02:05:26.436 --> 02:05:27.437
Come on.

02:05:30.524 --> 02:05:31.525
Wait, wait, wait.

02:05:32.192 --> 02:05:33.693
Try a couple practice
swings over there.

02:05:39.908 --> 02:05:40.909
Good.

02:05:41.201 --> 02:05:42.994
Now try and hit the same mark
again, Rose. You can do it.

02:05:49.709 --> 02:05:52.337
Okay, that's enough practice.
Come on, Rose.

02:05:52.337 --> 02:05:53.922
You can do it.

02:05:54.214 --> 02:05:57.884
Listen, just hit it really hard
and really fast.

02:05:59.261 --> 02:06:00.637
Come on. Wait.

02:06:00.637 --> 02:06:02.889
Open your
hands up a little more.

02:06:03.223 --> 02:06:04.558
- Like that?
- Right.

02:06:05.559 --> 02:06:07.602
Listen, Rose,
I trust you.

02:06:12.566 --> 02:06:13.567
Go.

02:06:19.906 --> 02:06:20.949
You did it!

02:06:21.575 --> 02:06:22.909
Come on. Let's go.

02:06:23.577 --> 02:06:25.579
Oh shit, this is cold!
Oh, shit!

02:06:25.912 --> 02:06:27.497
Shit! Shit!

02:06:33.086 --> 02:06:34.170
This is the way out.

02:06:35.255 --> 02:06:37.757
We have to find
another way. Come on.

02:06:40.802 --> 02:06:41.803
Pull.

02:06:42.846 --> 02:06:43.847
Put your backs into it.

02:06:49.811 --> 02:06:50.812
Pull!

02:06:51.771 --> 02:06:54.608
Now, there's something
you don't see every day.

02:07:16.463 --> 02:07:19.424
What's this luggage doing here?
Get rid of it. Get rid of it.

02:07:19.424 --> 02:07:20.508
We need the room.
Get rid of that. Out.

02:07:22.385 --> 02:07:25.388
This way.
Let go, sir. Get back.

02:07:25.639 --> 02:07:26.973
Keep calm!

02:07:34.314 --> 02:07:35.315
Lovejoy!

02:07:35.690 --> 02:07:37.692
She's not on the starboard side either.

02:07:37.984 --> 02:07:41.988
We're running out of time. This strutting
martinet isn't letting any men on at all.

02:07:42.656 --> 02:07:44.658
There's one on the other
side letting men on.

02:07:45.325 --> 02:07:46.785
Well then, that's our play.

02:07:46.785 --> 02:07:49.454
We'll need some
insurance first. Come on.

02:07:50.330 --> 02:07:52.415
This way, please.
All the way down here.

02:07:55.502 --> 02:07:56.503
Here!

02:07:57.712 --> 02:07:59.005
What do you
think you're doing?

02:07:59.506 --> 02:08:01.508
You'll have to pay for
that, you know.

02:08:01.758 --> 02:08:03.510
That's White Star
Line property.

02:08:03.843 --> 02:08:05.345
Shut up!

02:08:06.179 --> 02:08:09.349
Will you hold the boat a moment?
I just have to run back to my room--

02:08:10.183 --> 02:08:11.226
Sit down!

02:08:11.851 --> 02:08:13.061
She's the last.

02:08:13.061 --> 02:08:14.979
- Prepare to lower.
- Mr. Lightoller.

02:08:14.979 --> 02:08:16.898
Why are the boats being
launched half full?

02:08:17.190 --> 02:08:18.191
Not now, Mr. Andrews.

02:08:18.441 --> 02:08:21.611
There, look. 20 or so
in a boat built for 65?

02:08:21.861 --> 02:08:23.863
And I saw one boat
with only 12. 12!

02:08:24.197 --> 02:08:27.242
Well, we weren't sure of
the weight, Mr. Andrews.

02:08:27.450 --> 02:08:28.576
These boats may
buckle.

02:08:28.785 --> 02:08:29.786
Rubbish!

02:08:30.036 --> 02:08:32.706
They were tested in Belfast
with the weight of 70 men.

02:08:33.123 --> 02:08:35.583
Now, fill these boats, Mr. Lightoller.
For God's sake man!

02:08:42.882 --> 02:08:45.719
Please, I need more women
and children, please!

02:08:51.057 --> 02:08:52.225
Get back in there!

02:08:52.559 --> 02:08:55.061
This is not an exit.
This is not an exit.

02:08:57.647 --> 02:09:00.316
You can't keep us locked in here.
Like animals. The ship's bloody sinking.

02:09:01.568 --> 02:09:03.570
Bring forward the women!

02:09:03.903 --> 02:09:05.405
Unlock the gates.

02:09:06.239 --> 02:09:08.241
Women only!

02:09:08.908 --> 02:09:10.577
No men!

02:09:10.910 --> 02:09:12.412
No men!

02:09:16.916 --> 02:09:18.793
Get back!

02:09:20.086 --> 02:09:21.254
Get back!

02:09:21.254 --> 02:09:22.630
Lock the gates!

02:09:23.423 --> 02:09:24.799
Get them back
from those gates!

02:09:26.176 --> 02:09:27.469
Don't touch the gates!

02:09:31.097 --> 02:09:32.599
For God's sake, man...

02:09:32.599 --> 02:09:34.142
...there are women and
children down here!

02:09:34.434 --> 02:09:36.770
Let us up so we can have a chance!

02:09:37.812 --> 02:09:38.813
Get back!

02:09:42.567 --> 02:09:43.777
Tommy!

02:09:43.777 --> 02:09:45.278
- Can we get out?
- It's hopeless that way.

02:09:45.612 --> 02:09:47.030
Whatever we do,
we've got to do it fast.

02:09:50.784 --> 02:09:52.202
The boats are all going.

02:09:52.535 --> 02:09:54.454
This whole place is flooding.
We've gotta get out of here.

02:09:54.454 --> 02:09:55.497
There is niente this way.

02:09:56.623 --> 02:09:57.874
Let's go this way, all right?
Come on!

02:10:03.963 --> 02:10:05.131
I make my own luck.

02:10:05.465 --> 02:10:06.966
So do I.

02:10:14.808 --> 02:10:16.142
Come on!

02:10:16.643 --> 02:10:17.685
No, come on, let's go this way.

02:10:27.237 --> 02:10:28.404
This way!

02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:30.657
Just go back to
the main stairwell.

02:10:31.825 --> 02:10:33.117
And everything will be
sorted out there.

02:10:34.577 --> 02:10:36.412
It will all get sorted out back there.

02:10:36.788 --> 02:10:38.039
Go back to the main stairwell.

02:10:38.039 --> 02:10:39.999
- Open the gate!
- Go back down the main stairwell.

02:10:40.250 --> 02:10:41.584
Open the gate right now!

02:10:41.835 --> 02:10:43.920
Go back down the main
stairwell, like I told you.

02:10:46.172 --> 02:10:48.675
Goddamn it! Son of a bitch!

02:10:49.008 --> 02:10:50.677
Stop that!

02:10:54.597 --> 02:10:55.723
Fabri, Tommy,
give me a hand here.

02:10:55.723 --> 02:10:56.808
Move aside.

02:10:56.808 --> 02:10:58.977
Come on, pull!

02:10:59.853 --> 02:11:00.854
Pull!

02:11:01.855 --> 02:11:03.273
Move aside.
Quickly, move aside!

02:11:03.273 --> 02:11:04.357
Put that down!

02:11:04.357 --> 02:11:05.692
- Move aside!
- Put that down!

02:11:05.692 --> 02:11:07.026
One! Two!

02:11:07.944 --> 02:11:09.112
Three!

02:11:11.364 --> 02:11:12.532
Again!

02:11:14.534 --> 02:11:15.577
Now, let's go!

02:11:17.912 --> 02:11:19.038
Let's go, Rose.

02:11:19.038 --> 02:11:21.207
You can't go up there!
You can't do this!

02:11:27.547 --> 02:11:29.382
Keep order! Keep order here!

02:11:29.716 --> 02:11:32.552
Back! Back! Back!

02:11:37.140 --> 02:11:38.141
Hold on to her!

02:11:39.726 --> 02:11:40.768
Pull her in!

02:11:41.728 --> 02:11:44.230
Get back, I say, or I'll...

02:11:44.564 --> 02:11:46.733
...shoot you all like dogs!

02:11:47.066 --> 02:11:48.568
Keep order here!

02:11:49.569 --> 02:11:51.738
Keep order, I say.

02:11:52.572 --> 02:11:54.741
Mr. Lowe, man this boat.

02:11:59.245 --> 02:12:03.416
Right. ls everybody all right?
Nobody panic.

02:12:09.589 --> 02:12:11.257
Stay back.

02:12:11.758 --> 02:12:12.926
We're too late.

02:12:13.176 --> 02:12:16.262
There are more boats down the front.
Stay with this one. Murdoch.

02:12:16.512 --> 02:12:18.056
He seems to be quite practical.

02:12:22.769 --> 02:12:24.270
Don't lower it!

02:12:24.771 --> 02:12:26.773
Cut the falls!

02:12:32.278 --> 02:12:34.113
Sit down!

02:12:35.448 --> 02:12:36.866
Stay back, you lot!

02:12:37.116 --> 02:12:40.286
Just stay back, the
lot of you! Stay back!

02:12:42.956 --> 02:12:45.625
It's starting to fall apart.
We don't have much time.

02:12:47.293 --> 02:12:48.628
Mr. Murdoch?

02:12:48.962 --> 02:12:51.464
Mr. Hockley.
You two, with me, now!

02:12:51.714 --> 02:12:53.466
I'm a businessman, as you know...

02:12:53.466 --> 02:12:55.051
...and I have a business
proposition for you.

02:13:02.809 --> 02:13:03.977
Come on, Rose.

02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:08.481
The boats are gone!

02:13:14.153 --> 02:13:15.822
Colonel, are there
any boats on that side?

02:13:16.072 --> 02:13:18.616
No, miss, but there are a couple
of boats all the way forward.

02:13:18.616 --> 02:13:20.201
This way, I'll lead you.

02:13:26.416 --> 02:13:29.752
What's the use?
Nobody's listening to us anyway.

02:13:30.003 --> 02:13:31.671
Well, they don't listen to
us at dinner, either.

02:13:31.671 --> 02:13:32.880
Come on, let's play.

02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:34.215
Keep us warm.

02:13:35.008 --> 02:13:36.342
"Orpheus."

02:13:41.180 --> 02:13:43.975
Music to drown by.
Now I know I'm in first class.

02:13:49.856 --> 02:13:53.192
- Where is everyone?
- They're all still aft, sir.

02:13:55.194 --> 02:13:57.363
We have an understanding
then, Mr. Murdoch.

02:14:08.708 --> 02:14:12.712
Will the men please hold
back! Hold back, I say!

02:14:15.048 --> 02:14:18.009
Women and children only!

02:14:18.009 --> 02:14:19.927
Get back!

02:14:20.219 --> 02:14:22.889
Come through, madame.
This way. Step back, sir!

02:14:24.390 --> 02:14:27.226
You better check the
other side. Go!

02:14:34.567 --> 02:14:36.402
I found her, on the other side.

02:14:37.070 --> 02:14:38.488
Waiting for a boat.

02:14:38.988 --> 02:14:39.989
With him.

02:14:41.657 --> 02:14:43.743
- Any more women and children?
- They're all aboard, Mr. Murdoch.

02:14:44.077 --> 02:14:45.912
Anyone else then?

02:14:47.497 --> 02:14:48.915
- Anyone else?
- Do hurry. Hurry along.

02:14:55.088 --> 02:14:57.090
Goddamn it all to hell.

02:14:59.759 --> 02:15:01.094
Shit.

02:15:01.385 --> 02:15:02.386
Fire!

02:15:03.805 --> 02:15:05.723
Sir, sir, you can't
go through here.

02:15:09.352 --> 02:15:11.687
That's it.
Splendid. Right.

02:15:15.608 --> 02:15:17.276
Prepare to lower.

02:15:19.445 --> 02:15:21.280
Ready on the left.

02:15:27.203 --> 02:15:28.871
Take them down.

02:15:33.709 --> 02:15:35.044
Keep it steady.

02:15:37.713 --> 02:15:41.634
Both sides together.
Steady. Keep it steady.

02:15:42.677 --> 02:15:44.011
- Give her to me.
- Daddy.

02:15:44.846 --> 02:15:47.181
It'll be fine, darling.
Don't you worry.

02:15:47.515 --> 02:15:49.183
Daddy, get in the boat.

02:15:49.517 --> 02:15:52.353
It's good-bye for a little
while. Only for a little while.

02:15:52.603 --> 02:15:54.647
There'll be another
boat for the daddies.

02:15:55.231 --> 02:15:56.524
This boat is for the
mummies and the children.

02:15:56.524 --> 02:15:58.609
You hold Mummy's hand
and be a good little girl.

02:16:00.111 --> 02:16:01.445
I'm not going without you.

02:16:01.696 --> 02:16:03.364
No, you have
to go, now.

02:16:04.490 --> 02:16:05.867
Get in the
boat, Rose.

02:16:05.867 --> 02:16:07.118
No, Jack.

02:16:07.118 --> 02:16:08.202
Yes.

02:16:08.202 --> 02:16:09.287
Get on the boat!

02:16:09.287 --> 02:16:11.622
Yes, get on
the boat, Rose.

02:16:14.458 --> 02:16:15.626
Oh my God, look at you.

02:16:15.877 --> 02:16:17.795
You look a fright.

02:16:17.795 --> 02:16:18.796
Here.

02:16:20.548 --> 02:16:22.717
Put this on. Come.

02:16:27.722 --> 02:16:29.557
Go on. I'll get the next one.

02:16:29.807 --> 02:16:31.642
No, not without you.

02:16:31.893 --> 02:16:33.728
I'll be all right.
Listen, I'll be fine.

02:16:34.061 --> 02:16:35.897
I'm a survivor, all right?
Don't worry about me.

02:16:36.230 --> 02:16:37.523
Now, go on.
Get on.

02:16:38.065 --> 02:16:39.692
I have an arrangement with an
officer on the other side of the ship.

02:16:40.151 --> 02:16:41.694
Jack and I can
get off safely.

02:16:42.236 --> 02:16:43.237
Both of us.

02:16:44.405 --> 02:16:45.573
See?

02:16:45.573 --> 02:16:46.616
I got my own
boat to catch.

02:16:47.408 --> 02:16:48.492
Go on, hurry.

02:16:48.492 --> 02:16:49.911
They're almost full.

02:16:51.412 --> 02:16:52.538
- Step aboard, miss.
- Go. Go.

02:16:54.415 --> 02:16:55.583
Step aboard, please.

02:16:55.875 --> 02:16:57.376
You're daddy's
good girl, all right?

02:16:57.376 --> 02:16:58.502
You're my little sailor.

02:17:02.757 --> 02:17:03.758
Clear the rail, please.

02:17:05.426 --> 02:17:06.677
And, lower away!

02:17:20.524 --> 02:17:21.859
You're a good liar.

02:17:22.610 --> 02:17:24.445
Almost as good as you.

02:17:29.116 --> 02:17:32.787
There's no-- there's no
arrangement, is there?

02:17:34.121 --> 02:17:35.623
No, there is.

02:17:35.957 --> 02:17:38.125
Not that you'll benefit much from it.

02:17:40.044 --> 02:17:41.712
I always win, Jack.

02:17:42.797 --> 02:17:44.465
One way or another.

02:18:42.606 --> 02:18:43.649
Rose!

02:18:46.027 --> 02:18:47.028
Stop her!

02:18:47.778 --> 02:18:48.779
Rose, what
are you doing?!

02:18:50.865 --> 02:18:51.866
No!

02:19:14.889 --> 02:19:17.558
Rose! You're so stupid!
Why did you do that, huh?

02:19:17.892 --> 02:19:19.894
You're so stupid, Rose.

02:19:21.228 --> 02:19:22.897
Why did you
do that? Why?!

02:19:24.231 --> 02:19:26.233
You jump,
I lump, right?

02:19:28.069 --> 02:19:29.111
Right.

02:19:31.781 --> 02:19:33.366
Oh God.
I couldn't go.

02:19:34.325 --> 02:19:35.910
I couldn't
go, Jack.

02:19:35.910 --> 02:19:37.578
It's all right. We'll
think of something.

02:19:39.246 --> 02:19:40.748
- At least I'm with you.
- We'll think of something.

02:19:55.221 --> 02:19:56.263
Come on! Move!

02:19:59.600 --> 02:20:00.601
Come on!
Move.

02:20:07.400 --> 02:20:08.401
Come on!

02:20:16.534 --> 02:20:17.535
Move!

02:20:23.791 --> 02:20:25.292
Come on!
Come on Rose.

02:20:27.878 --> 02:20:28.879
Rose, come on!

02:20:31.882 --> 02:20:32.925
Move Rose!

02:20:36.011 --> 02:20:37.012
Go!

02:20:47.606 --> 02:20:50.317
I hope you enjoy your time together!

02:21:04.331 --> 02:21:06.667
What could
possibly be funny?

02:21:08.085 --> 02:21:09.837
I put the diamond
in the coat.

02:21:12.590 --> 02:21:14.508
And I put the
coat on her!

02:21:16.260 --> 02:21:17.344
Come on!

02:21:37.615 --> 02:21:39.033
Dada!

02:21:41.368 --> 02:21:42.495
We can't leave him.

02:21:47.041 --> 02:21:48.375
All right, come on!

02:21:50.044 --> 02:21:52.213
Dada!

02:22:05.309 --> 02:22:06.644
Go back!

02:22:17.363 --> 02:22:18.614
It's the wrong way!
Come back!

02:22:18.614 --> 02:22:21.200
No, not that way!
Come back! Stop!

02:22:26.247 --> 02:22:27.414
Go!

02:22:29.750 --> 02:22:33.420
Go! Run!

02:22:59.113 --> 02:23:00.114
This way!

02:23:12.293 --> 02:23:13.460
Give me your hand!

02:23:22.469 --> 02:23:23.804
Oh, God!

02:23:28.142 --> 02:23:29.310
Help!

02:23:35.149 --> 02:23:36.483
Help!

02:23:37.943 --> 02:23:39.111
Wait, sir!

02:23:39.111 --> 02:23:40.654
Sir, open the gate, please!

02:23:40.904 --> 02:23:42.072
Help us, please!

02:23:42.323 --> 02:23:43.657
Help us!

02:23:43.657 --> 02:23:44.825
- Please!
- Please!

02:23:46.493 --> 02:23:47.828
Bloody hell!

02:23:53.500 --> 02:23:55.502
- Come on, come on!
- Come on!

02:23:55.836 --> 02:23:57.171
Go, go!

02:23:57.421 --> 02:23:58.422
Jesus.

02:23:59.506 --> 02:24:00.507
- Please!
- Come on!

02:24:00.758 --> 02:24:02.009
Hurry!

02:24:02.885 --> 02:24:03.927
Come on!

02:24:08.515 --> 02:24:10.267
I'm sorry, I
dropped the keys.

02:24:11.518 --> 02:24:13.687
- Wait, please!
- Wait!

02:24:14.021 --> 02:24:16.523
Don't leave! Please,
send for help!

02:24:35.209 --> 02:24:37.211
I got it! Which
one is it, Rose?

02:24:37.544 --> 02:24:39.546
The short one.
Try the short one.

02:24:40.547 --> 02:24:41.548
Hurry, Jack.

02:24:45.219 --> 02:24:46.887
Oh no! It won't go in.

02:24:47.805 --> 02:24:48.806
Hurry, Jack.

02:24:51.392 --> 02:24:53.310
It's stuck! It's stuck!

02:24:54.561 --> 02:24:56.230
- Come on!
- Hurry, Jack!

02:24:57.898 --> 02:24:59.566
- Hurry, Jack!
- Come on!

02:25:02.236 --> 02:25:04.238
I got it! I got it!
Go! Go, Rose!

02:25:05.239 --> 02:25:06.573
Go! Go!

02:25:18.919 --> 02:25:21.255
Jack! Come on!

02:25:23.257 --> 02:25:24.758
Move, move.

02:25:34.601 --> 02:25:36.437
- Get those oars in place.
- Get an oar under it.

02:25:41.608 --> 02:25:43.277
Hold it! Hold it!

02:25:43.610 --> 02:25:44.945
Hold it!

02:25:54.872 --> 02:25:59.126
Get these davits cranked in!
Let's get the falls hooked up!

02:26:11.305 --> 02:26:13.140
Mommy!

02:26:19.813 --> 02:26:20.898
Keep going up!

02:26:24.151 --> 02:26:25.652
Stop pushing!

02:26:27.821 --> 02:26:29.156
Stay back!

02:26:29.406 --> 02:26:31.909
Will you give us a chance
to live, you limey bastard!

02:26:32.159 --> 02:26:34.828
I'll shoot any man who tries
to get past me! Get back!

02:26:34.828 --> 02:26:35.913
Bastard!

02:26:36.163 --> 02:26:37.831
Get back!

02:26:37.831 --> 02:26:38.916
We had a deal,
damn you!

02:26:42.336 --> 02:26:45.464
Your money can't save you
any more than it could save me.

02:26:45.464 --> 02:26:46.465
Get back!

02:26:47.674 --> 02:26:49.593
Women and children only!

02:26:58.519 --> 02:26:59.853
No, Tommy!

02:27:18.580 --> 02:27:19.581
No, Will!

02:27:26.463 --> 02:27:27.965
Now stand
back, damn you!

02:27:31.301 --> 02:27:34.805
Gently, gently. Hold it. Hold it.

02:27:44.481 --> 02:27:46.149
I have a child!

02:27:46.483 --> 02:27:48.610
- I have a child!
- Clear a path here!

02:27:48.986 --> 02:27:50.988
Please, I have a child!

02:27:51.822 --> 02:27:54.491
Please. I'm all she has in the world.

02:27:55.450 --> 02:27:56.493
Go on.

02:27:56.827 --> 02:27:57.828
Step back!

02:27:58.328 --> 02:27:59.663
- Please?
- Here, give herto me.

02:28:00.372 --> 02:28:01.790
You're all right, dearie.

02:28:04.877 --> 02:28:05.961
Give her here.

02:28:07.880 --> 02:28:08.881
There, there.

02:28:13.176 --> 02:28:16.013
Wait, wait, wait! Mr. Andrews!

02:28:18.515 --> 02:28:19.516
Oh, Rose.

02:28:22.519 --> 02:28:23.854
Won't you even
make a try for it?

02:28:25.856 --> 02:28:30.360
I'm sorry that I didn't build you
a stronger ship, young Rose.

02:28:32.195 --> 02:28:34.531
It's going fast.
We have to move.

02:28:34.823 --> 02:28:35.824
Wait.

02:28:38.869 --> 02:28:40.329
Good luck to you, Rose.

02:28:42.372 --> 02:28:43.373
And to you.

02:28:56.345 --> 02:28:57.387
Mr. Guggenheim?

02:28:57.846 --> 02:28:59.014
These are for you, Mr. Guggenheim.

02:28:59.222 --> 02:29:00.390
No, thank you.

02:29:00.390 --> 02:29:04.269
We are dressed in our best and are
prepared to go down as gentlemen.

02:29:05.062 --> 02:29:07.022
But we would
like a brandy.

02:29:07.731 --> 02:29:10.233
Get the falls over here now!

02:29:10.901 --> 02:29:13.362
Let them drop. Then we'll right it.

02:29:18.617 --> 02:29:19.743
CapitÃ©n ?

02:29:20.243 --> 02:29:22.579
CapitÃ©n, where should I go? Please.

02:29:29.920 --> 02:29:31.922
Captain. Captain. Sir.

02:30:02.411 --> 02:30:04.621
Right.
That's it, then.

02:30:05.455 --> 02:30:07.082
Good-bye, Wally.
Good luck.

02:30:08.125 --> 02:30:09.292
- Good-bye, Wallace.
- So long, old chap.

02:31:24.534 --> 02:31:29.039
And so they lived happily
together for 300 years...

02:31:29.372 --> 02:31:31.541
...in the land of Tir na nog...

02:31:32.542 --> 02:31:35.212
Land of eternal
youth and beauty.

02:32:10.580 --> 02:32:12.082
There's no time!

02:32:12.082 --> 02:32:13.458
Cut those falls!

02:32:13.708 --> 02:32:15.877
Cut them!
Cut them if you have to!

02:32:16.586 --> 02:32:19.256
I need a knife!

02:32:20.924 --> 02:32:22.592
Cut the falls now!

02:32:23.218 --> 02:32:24.594
Cut them loose!

02:32:35.105 --> 02:32:36.940
Cut those bloody falls!

02:33:24.613 --> 02:33:25.947
Gentlemen...

02:33:26.448 --> 02:33:29.117
...it has been a privilege
playing with you tonight.

02:34:29.928 --> 02:34:31.972
We have to stay on the
ship as long as possible.

02:34:31.972 --> 02:34:32.973
Come on!

02:34:45.026 --> 02:34:46.695
This way.
Through the rail.

02:34:48.947 --> 02:34:50.282
Come on, Rose.

02:34:50.615 --> 02:34:51.616
Jump.

02:34:53.952 --> 02:34:55.036
Come on.

02:35:28.320 --> 02:35:29.904
I got you.
Jump.

02:35:32.574 --> 02:35:34.409
I've got you, miss.

02:35:38.246 --> 02:35:39.414
Back!

02:36:09.611 --> 02:36:11.279
No! You'll swamp us!

02:36:24.042 --> 02:36:27.128
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death--

02:36:27.462 --> 02:36:30.215
You wanna walk a little faster
through that valley there?

02:37:20.515 --> 02:37:22.183
Holy Mary, mother of God...

02:37:22.183 --> 02:37:25.145
...pray for us sinners now and
at the hour of our death. Amen.

02:37:25.854 --> 02:37:27.021
Hail Mary, full of grace...

02:37:27.021 --> 02:37:28.106
This way.

02:37:38.450 --> 02:37:40.535
Come on!

02:37:50.211 --> 02:37:52.630
And I saw a new heaven
and a new earth...

02:37:52.881 --> 02:37:56.384
...for the first heaven and the first earth
had passed away...

02:37:57.469 --> 02:37:59.053
...and there was no more sea.

02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:08.646
It'll be over soon.
It'll all be over soon.

02:38:14.235 --> 02:38:15.904
And He shall dwell with them.

02:38:15.904 --> 02:38:20.325
And they shall be His people
and God Himself shall be with them...

02:38:20.658 --> 02:38:22.076
...and be their God.

02:38:22.827 --> 02:38:23.912
Jack...

02:38:24.913 --> 02:38:26.915
...this is where
we first met.

02:38:33.963 --> 02:38:37.175
And God shall wipe away
all the tears from their eyes...

02:38:37.509 --> 02:38:39.594
...and there shall be
no more death.

02:38:40.094 --> 02:38:42.597
Neither shall there be
sorrow or crying.

02:38:43.097 --> 02:38:45.600
Neither shall there
be any more pain...

02:38:46.434 --> 02:38:49.187
...for the former world
has passed away.

02:39:03.618 --> 02:39:05.954
Bloody pull faster!
And pull!

02:39:29.227 --> 02:39:30.562
Hang on, miss Trudy!

02:40:06.514 --> 02:40:08.016
Hold on real tight.

02:40:25.533 --> 02:40:27.368
God Almighty.

02:40:34.834 --> 02:40:37.378
Keep those breakers in!
Keep them in!

02:41:56.374 --> 02:41:57.792
We have to move!

02:42:03.715 --> 02:42:05.133
Give me your hand.
I'll pull you over.

02:42:05.133 --> 02:42:06.259
I can't.

02:42:06.259 --> 02:42:07.343
Come on!

02:42:07.343 --> 02:42:08.386
Give me your hand.

02:42:10.138 --> 02:42:12.140
I've got you.
I won't let go.

02:42:12.724 --> 02:42:13.766
Come on,
I've got you.

02:42:24.986 --> 02:42:28.156
- What's happening, Jack?
- I don't know. I don't know.

02:42:37.331 --> 02:42:38.332
Hold on.

02:43:20.708 --> 02:43:21.876
This is it!

02:43:33.888 --> 02:43:37.558
Oh, my God, Jack!
Oh, God. Oh, God.

02:43:38.226 --> 02:43:39.560
Hold on!

02:43:54.575 --> 02:43:56.577
The ship is gonna suck us down.

02:43:56.577 --> 02:43:58.788
Take a deep
breath when I say.

02:44:04.418 --> 02:44:06.629
Kick for the surface
and keep kicking.

02:44:06.629 --> 02:44:07.964
Do not let go
of my hand.

02:44:15.680 --> 02:44:16.973
We're going to make it, Rose.

02:44:16.973 --> 02:44:18.099
Trust me.

02:44:18.099 --> 02:44:19.350
I trust you.

02:44:24.438 --> 02:44:26.440
Ready! Ready!

02:44:26.941 --> 02:44:27.942
NOW!

02:45:04.312 --> 02:45:06.147
Jack! Jack!

02:45:49.190 --> 02:45:50.191
Rose!

02:45:50.691 --> 02:45:53.027
Get off her!
Get off her!

02:45:57.239 --> 02:45:58.908
Swim, Rose! I need
you to swim!

02:46:03.704 --> 02:46:05.373
Keep swimming.

02:46:09.043 --> 02:46:10.378
It's so cold.

02:46:10.628 --> 02:46:11.963
Swim, Rose!

02:46:16.550 --> 02:46:17.885
Come on.

02:46:19.887 --> 02:46:20.972
Keep swimming.

02:46:21.222 --> 02:46:22.556
Come on.

02:46:24.517 --> 02:46:25.685
Here...

02:46:25.685 --> 02:46:26.852
...get on it.

02:46:27.561 --> 02:46:29.063
Get on top.

02:46:36.445 --> 02:46:37.905
Come on, Rose.

02:46:47.456 --> 02:46:49.125
Stay on it.
Stay on, Rose.

02:47:10.980 --> 02:47:12.481
It'll be all right now.

02:47:14.984 --> 02:47:16.485
It'll be all right now.

02:47:23.826 --> 02:47:24.994
Return...

02:47:25.202 --> 02:47:26.871
...the boats!

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.127
The boats are coming
back for us Rose.

02:47:33.669 --> 02:47:35.129
Hold on just a
little bit longer.

02:47:36.005 --> 02:47:38.674
They had to row
away for the suction...

02:47:38.883 --> 02:47:40.968
...but now they'll
be coming back.

02:47:44.013 --> 02:47:45.347
For God's sake!

02:47:45.639 --> 02:47:46.849
Please...

02:47:47.183 --> 02:47:48.476
...help us!

02:47:53.856 --> 02:47:55.566
You don't understand.

02:47:56.400 --> 02:47:58.569
If we go back, they'll
swamp the boat.

02:47:58.819 --> 02:48:00.154
They'll pull us right down,
I'm telling you.

02:48:00.696 --> 02:48:03.199
Oh, knock it off.
You're scaring me.

02:48:03.532 --> 02:48:06.035
Come on, girls, grab
an oar. Let's go.

02:48:06.327 --> 02:48:09.497
Are you out of your mind?
We're in the middle of the North Atlantic.

02:48:09.705 --> 02:48:13.042
Now, do you people want to live
or do you want to die?!

02:48:20.007 --> 02:48:22.218
I don't understand a one of you.

02:48:24.053 --> 02:48:25.179
What's the matter with you?

02:48:26.180 --> 02:48:27.598
It's your men out there!

02:48:30.059 --> 02:48:31.727
There's plenty of room for more.

02:48:32.019 --> 02:48:33.687
And there'll be one less
on this boat...

02:48:34.021 --> 02:48:37.399
...if you don't shut that
hole in your face!

02:48:53.249 --> 02:48:57.378
Now, bring in your oars over there-
And tie these boats together as well

02:49:01.757 --> 02:49:04.093
Now, make sure that's
tied up nice and tight.

02:49:07.596 --> 02:49:10.266
Right, listen to me, men.
We have to go back.

02:49:10.599 --> 02:49:14.228
I want to transfer all the women
from this boat into that boat right now...

02:49:14.228 --> 02:49:15.437
...as quick as you can, please.

02:49:15.437 --> 02:49:17.940
Let's create some space over there.
Move forward and aft.

02:49:27.950 --> 02:49:29.785
It's getting quiet.

02:49:31.954 --> 02:49:35.291
It's just going to take a
couple of minutes...

02:49:35.791 --> 02:49:37.793
...to get the boats organized.

02:49:40.629 --> 02:49:42.298
I don't know about you but...

02:49:42.631 --> 02:49:46.135
...I intend to write
a strongly worded letter...

02:49:46.468 --> 02:49:48.095
...to the White Star Line
about all this.

02:49:56.478 --> 02:49:58.147
I love you, Jack.

02:50:04.820 --> 02:50:06.322
Don't you do that.

02:50:07.823 --> 02:50:10.993
Don't you say your
good-byes. Not yet.

02:50:11.327 --> 02:50:12.828
Do you understand me?

02:50:13.162 --> 02:50:14.997
I'm so cold.

02:50:15.497 --> 02:50:16.999
Listen, Rose...

02:50:18.167 --> 02:50:19.835
...you're gonna
get out of here.

02:50:21.003 --> 02:50:22.504
You're gonna go on...

02:50:23.839 --> 02:50:25.633
...and you're gonna
make lots of babies.

02:50:26.342 --> 02:50:28.344
And you're gonna
watch them grow.

02:50:30.012 --> 02:50:31.305
You're gonna die an old...

02:50:31.305 --> 02:50:32.556
...an old lady.

02:50:32.848 --> 02:50:34.516
...Warm in her bed.

02:50:36.185 --> 02:50:37.311
Not here.

02:50:38.187 --> 02:50:40.689
Not this night.
Not like this.

02:50:41.023 --> 02:50:42.691
Do you understand me?

02:50:45.694 --> 02:50:47.863
I can't feel my body.

02:50:49.531 --> 02:50:51.158
Winning that ticket, Rose...

02:50:51.158 --> 02:50:53.744
...was the best thing that
ever happened to me.

02:50:55.371 --> 02:50:57.206
It brought me to you.

02:50:58.832 --> 02:51:01.293
And I'm thankful
for that, Rose-

02:51:01.835 --> 02:51:03.170
I'm thankful.

02:51:06.632 --> 02:51:07.716
You must...

02:51:08.842 --> 02:51:10.844
...you must do me
this honor.

02:51:13.847 --> 02:51:17.351
You must promise me
that you'll survive.

02:51:19.353 --> 02:51:21.021
That you won't give up...

02:51:22.189 --> 02:51:24.191
...no matter what happens.

02:51:26.860 --> 02:51:29.196
No matter how hopeless.

02:51:32.366 --> 02:51:34.535
Promise me now, Rose.

02:51:36.704 --> 02:51:39.039
And never let go
of that promise.

02:51:40.708 --> 02:51:42.042
I promise.

02:51:44.169 --> 02:51:45.838
Never let go.

02:51:48.716 --> 02:51:50.843
I'll never let go, Jack.

02:51:53.554 --> 02:51:55.222
I'll never let go.

02:52:19.330 --> 02:52:20.831
Right ahead, sir.

02:52:24.001 --> 02:52:25.502
Oars!

02:52:26.003 --> 02:52:27.671
Do you see any moving?

02:52:28.672 --> 02:52:30.591
No, sir. None
moving, sir.

02:52:31.175 --> 02:52:32.509
Check them.

02:52:32.843 --> 02:52:34.345
Bring that oar up here.

02:52:41.018 --> 02:52:42.019
Check them.
Make sure.

02:52:43.437 --> 02:52:45.064
These are dead, sir.

02:52:45.564 --> 02:52:46.732
Now, give way.

02:52:47.191 --> 02:52:48.233
Ahead easy.

02:52:55.032 --> 02:52:56.533
Careful with your oars.

02:52:57.117 --> 02:52:58.160
Don't hit them.

02:53:00.704 --> 02:53:03.040
Is there anyone
alive out there?

02:53:04.541 --> 02:53:06.377
Can anyone hear me?

02:53:08.545 --> 02:53:10.881
Is there anyone
alive out there?

02:53:17.721 --> 02:53:18.931
We waited too long.

02:53:22.851 --> 02:53:24.728
Well, keep checking them!

02:53:24.728 --> 02:53:26.397
Keep looking!

02:53:27.231 --> 02:53:29.733
Is there anyone
alive out there?

02:53:33.237 --> 02:53:35.239
Can anyone hear me?

02:53:46.417 --> 02:53:49.253
Come, Josephine...

02:53:49.753 --> 02:53:54.258
...in my ï¬ying machine

02:53:55.759 --> 02:53:58.971
And it's up she goes

02:54:00.931 --> 02:54:02.933
Up she goes

02:54:08.439 --> 02:54:10.607
Come, Josephine...

02:54:12.943 --> 02:54:15.279
___in my ï¬y'-"9""

02:54:39.136 --> 02:54:40.471
Jack.

02:54:58.322 --> 02:54:59.656
Jack.

02:55:00.157 --> 02:55:01.492
There's a boat.

02:55:14.671 --> 02:55:16.006
Jack.

02:55:28.519 --> 02:55:30.521
There's a
boat, Jack.

02:56:14.231 --> 02:56:15.566
Come back.

02:56:16.733 --> 02:56:18.235
Come back.

02:56:20.404 --> 02:56:21.738
Come back.

02:56:22.906 --> 02:56:24.408
Come back.

02:56:25.242 --> 02:56:26.743
Come back.

02:56:27.578 --> 02:56:29.913
Come back.
Come back!

02:56:31.415 --> 02:56:32.916
Hello!

02:56:35.043 --> 02:56:36.920
Can anyone hear me?

02:56:37.421 --> 02:56:39.089
There's nothing
here, sir.

02:56:41.592 --> 02:56:42.926
Come back.

02:56:44.428 --> 02:56:45.762
Come back.

02:56:53.604 --> 02:56:55.105
I'll never let go.

02:56:55.355 --> 02:56:56.690
I promise.

02:57:39.775 --> 02:57:41.610
Come about!

02:58:02.964 --> 02:58:06.802
Fifteen hundred people
went into the sea...

02:58:07.135 --> 02:58:10.138
...when Titanic
sank from under us.

02:58:11.973 --> 02:58:15.143
There were twenty
boats floating nearby...

02:58:16.311 --> 02:58:18.647
...and only one came back.

02:58:20.482 --> 02:58:21.608
One.

02:58:23.318 --> 02:58:25.987
Six were saved
from the water...

02:58:26.488 --> 02:58:28.156
...myself included.

02:58:29.324 --> 02:58:30.617
Six...

02:58:31.827 --> 02:58:33.704
...out of fifteen hundred.

02:58:36.998 --> 02:58:38.333
Afterward...

02:58:39.501 --> 02:58:41.503
...the seven hundred
people in the boats...

02:58:42.295 --> 02:58:44.381
...had nothing to
do but wait.

02:58:46.007 --> 02:58:47.676
Wait to die.

02:58:48.176 --> 02:58:49.678
Wait to live.

02:58:50.846 --> 02:58:53.014
Wait for an absolution...

02:58:53.515 --> 02:58:55.350
...that would never come.

02:59:59.581 --> 03:00:02.209
Sir, I don't think you'll find any
of your people down here.

03:00:02.209 --> 03:00:03.627
It's all steerage.

03:00:06.588 --> 03:00:10.258
His hair is reddish brown,
reddish brown, reddish brown.

03:00:10.258 --> 03:00:11.635
White beard.

03:00:12.093 --> 03:00:13.762
Isn't there another
passenger list?

03:00:13.762 --> 03:00:15.055
There is no other list.

03:00:15.055 --> 03:00:16.473
Perhaps he's on
another ship.

03:00:16.765 --> 03:00:18.600
We're doing all we can,
ma'am. I'm so sorry.

03:00:41.957 --> 03:00:44.626
That's the last time
I ever saw him.

03:00:45.126 --> 03:00:48.630
He married, of course,
and inherited his millions.

03:00:49.297 --> 03:00:52.801
But the Crash of '29 hit his interests hard...

03:00:53.134 --> 03:00:55.428
...and he put a pistol in
his mouth that year.

03:00:55.971 --> 03:00:57.806
Or so I read.

03:01:10.652 --> 03:01:12.112
Can I take your name
please, love?

03:01:15.156 --> 03:01:16.491
Dawson.

03:01:18.660 --> 03:01:20.161
Rose Dawson.

03:01:21.496 --> 03:01:22.664
Thank you.

03:01:29.671 --> 03:01:31.965
We never found
anything on Jack.

03:01:31.965 --> 03:01:33.884
There's no record
of him at all.

03:01:34.509 --> 03:01:36.845
No, there wouldn't
be, would there?

03:01:37.178 --> 03:01:39.890
And I've never spoken
of him until now.

03:01:40.640 --> 03:01:41.683
Not to anyone.

03:01:42.851 --> 03:01:44.853
Not even your
grandfather.

03:01:45.186 --> 03:01:49.190
A woman's heart is a
deep ocean of secrets.

03:01:50.025 --> 03:01:53.695
But now you know there was
a man named Jack Dawson...

03:01:54.029 --> 03:01:56.031
...and that he saved me...

03:01:56.364 --> 03:01:59.701
...in every way that
a person can be saved.

03:02:01.703 --> 03:02:04.372
I don't even have
a picture of him.

03:02:06.875 --> 03:02:10.712
He exists now only
in my memory.

03:02:15.550 --> 03:02:19.054
Keldysh, Mir 2 on our
way to the surface.

03:02:35.570 --> 03:02:38.365
I was saving this for when
I found the diamond.

03:02:47.749 --> 03:02:49.250
I'm sorry.

03:02:51.920 --> 03:02:53.421
Three years...

03:02:54.089 --> 03:02:56.758
...I've thought of
nothing except Titanic.

03:02:57.592 --> 03:02:59.427
But I never got it.

03:03:02.555 --> 03:03:04.432
I never let it in.
